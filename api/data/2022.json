          "description": "Being a privacy enthusiast and an end user, the idea proposed by LEAP group for implementing Client-side Tracking-, Malware and Ad-Blocker really caught my attention. \n\nIn this digital era, most important thing  whenever surfing the internet; is protecting yourself and your loved ones from the malwares, trackers and adwares. Implementing features like filtering DNS requests and blocking the particulars would help in maintaining privacy and protection. \nIn this project, I would be working on the client-side approach for creating the blocker. The blocker would work across different platforms including- Desktop, Android, Linux and Mac. For developing the UI Components of the blocker, I will go with QT5 as the LEAP projects use the same. And for the Android implementation, I will be using Java and Android-specific XML.\n\nFirstly, in the main desktop client- the features of blockers would be included in the settings menu along with a simple feature switch. Pre-configured blocking lists would be shipped with each release. This would help us in filtering out the DNS requests and blocking the IPs in our target blocking list.\nI will package the entire solution in a self-contained Go Library that will be able to read packages from a given file descriptor and work accordingly.\n\nFuture Scope includes implementation in iOS environment and  implementing update mechanism.",

Current implementation of this uses a simple lexical (token-based) static analysis which is not up to date with the newer features in the Python language and it does not fully support C++. In order to expand these checks, the proposed solution for this is to produce and analyze the Abstract syntax tree (AST) of the submitted code. This generated AST can also be integrated with the implementation of the Lichen Plagiarism Detection module. It is also expected to create additional autograding tutorial examples and corresponding continuous integration regression testing by the end of the project.",

On the other hand, many projects today are done in Python, almost excuslively using Numpy for their numerical operations (like data arrays). \nPython and Numpy are actually written in C, therefore they have very well-defined interfaces for communicating with installed C libraries, using CPython. Since both Gnuastro and Numpy's core data structure are very similar, we plan on building a converter between the two. This will make it possible to perform all data operations using Numpys C-API. This will be followed by adding a low-level wrapper infra-structure which will allow easy usage of Gnuastro’s powerful libraries in Python.\nThus, the final goal is to have Gnuastro be an importable module in Python (just like Numpy) and have all the inner data operations of Gnuastro be performed using Numpy's C-API.",

          "description": "Stingray is a python package that provides a common platform for time series analysis of X-ray data to the astronomy community. One important aspect of time series analysis of astronomical sources is to identify and characterize their variability from their light curves. The light curves of these sources are affected by spurious variability from variable backgrounds and gaps due to occultation or inaccessibility of the source. This causes data to be affected by Poissonian uncertainties. In the case of sources that are near to detection limit of telescope, these uncertainties are dominant.\n\nBayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) is a statistical method to measure variability in Poisson-distributed data. The method has been developed to analyze X-Ray light curves of faint sources observed by eROSITA telescope. Bexvar is a Bayesian formulation of the excess variance method.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement this method in Stingray, create test cases for the method based on real observational data and write appropriate documentation.",

          "description": "Current bioinformatics formats such as FASTQ, SAM, and VCF have been used in production for 10+ years via htslib/htsjdk. These are largely tabular text formats that are limited by their commitment to instant human-readability. On the other hand, other data file formats that exploit data locality, compression and other optimizations have been developed over the years to work with data sets from several other fields with different requirements than bioinformatics. These promise significant improvements over plaintext formats, including specialized compression, native data types, and efficient random access.\n\nThis project does not aim to create yet another format, instead, the goal is to explore the feasibility, and potential advantages of the serialization of bioinformatics formats into (potentially) many others for benchmarking purposes. To achieve this goal, we will implement additional serialization formats in the existing Noodles serialization library (see serde.rs for a short non-comprehensive list of currently supported output formats). Think of it like a rosetta stone from traditional bioinformatics formats to (ideally) the rest, where reasonable.\n\nNoodles, a Rust library that implements most of the high throughput sequencing (hts) specs already contains the most popular bioinformatics file format structs. This evaluation could be carried on by annotating the structures and semantics (providing a so-called IR, or “Internal Representation”) that the currently available bioinformatic file formats are built upon.\n\nThe end goal of this project would be to provide means to convert htslib format(s) into other binary representations (such as Apache Feather, Parquet, ORC, etc.) and then evaluate its convenience and performance via a benchmarking suite.",

However, with the recent research on big data analysis, formats that focus on performance would greatly improve the potential to work with big genomics datasets.\n\nThis project aims to be a step towards discovering the advantages of the many possible formats in many possible scenarios, by making it easy to translate any one of them to another. Such an objective seems useful for: \nDiscovering the optimal format for performance critical applications.\nEasy conversion from one tool to another, for bioinformatics researchers and hackers.\n\nWe will achieve that by using an Internal Representation of the different possible semantic data represented in each format, that will then allow translation from one format to another. This IR will probably be built in one of the widely used standard file formats, such as Protocol Buffers or Amazon’s Ion, since these technologies are already being widely used and already have great performance and a lot of features built into them.",

In machine learning, 3D or 4D representation provides more depth information than the 2D representation, many of the tasks may be much better understood if we provide a 3D or 4D. But OpenVINO has no native real-time 3D visualization engine or library. This can be very troublesome for users who use display 3D images. So our goal is working natural 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO (AI inference). There are a few solutions in Jupyter 3D graphic display, though:\n\n1. Requires complex setup, build or is not friendly to the average user (without graphics programming experience)\n2. Not integration with OpenVINO(Need process different data and different inference results available from OpenVINO, the user only needs a simple interface to set this up)\n\nThe project idea aims at fill in the gaps mentioned above:\n\n1. Provides a clean interface to set up the display of these graphics without the need for a graphical programming background(beginner-friendly)\n2. 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO(Be able to transform and process the output data of OpenVino)",

The libraries include but are not limited to HoloViz, Plotly, Bokeh, and more. \n\nI’m especially fond of the HoloViz panel which could potentially be beneficial for the case study. There is a lot of room for description, examples, custom selection, and more. Tailoring the use-case for our purposes shouldn’t be a hard task (gathering information and testing would!). The best thing about this approach is that it's easy to test and create working prototypes without losing any time.",

          "description": "Artifacts are parts of a measured signal generated from sources other than those of interest. For electroencephalography (EEG) data, artifacts from a variety of physiological and environmental sources must be excluded or repaired to ensure that appropriate interpretations are applied during clinical evaluation and downstream analyses. We will develop a suite of web-based tools for facilitating artifact annotations for the Global EEG Norms project of the Global Brain Consortium (GBC). This project will enable clinical neurophysiologists to upload EEG data in standardized formats; annotate data with artifacts, such as electrical noise and movement artifacts, using a novel ontology that is interoperable with the Hierarchical Event Descriptors specification; and export this data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard. While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web. This could reduce the barriers to entry for neurophysiology research by enabling standalone data management and analysis applications to be released on modern browsers. In the long run, this may enable the rapid diagnosis of neurological disorders in lower to middle-income countries with unreliable internet connections.",

Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired.\nDiffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important.

          "description": "Biologically detailed models are useful tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are now routinely applied to construct and validate such models based on the relevant experimental data. The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors.\n\nThe aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization\n2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used\n3.

Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example.\n\nThis project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data. The primary goal of this project is to develop Python utilities for augmenting event camera recordings of objects captured in an academic setting in various ways to create benchmark datasets.

Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. \nHowever, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. \nIn its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user.

The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",

For this project, I will construct and simulate a PyGeNN model of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) by reproducing the point-neuron V1 model created by Billeh et al. (2020). Taking advantage of GPU-acceleration, the PyGeNN model will be able to simulate V1 neural activity in real time. \n\nI will first implement a generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (GLIF) neuron class, which will govern the spiking behavior of neurons during simulation. Next, I will construct the network by connecting V1, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and background (BKG) neurons, using the parameters calculated by Billeh et al. (2020). To validate the model, I will compare the results of PyGeNN simulations to those of BMTK/NEST simulations. Finally, I will construct an application that simulates V1 activity in response to a webcam stream in real time. If time permits, I will enhance this application by implementing a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet LGN model, which will increase the maximum frame rate that can be simulated in real time. \n\nThe results of this project will include: (1) a complete model of mouse V1, (2) validation results and benchmark comparisons to BMTK/NEST simulations, (3) a webcam application showing simulated neural activity in real time, and (4) if time permits, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet model.",

Although it is faster compared to SRAM it has disadvantages including increased size, higher energy consumption, and reduced efficiency. The major goal of this project is to emulate a novel approach for TCAM functionality by emulating it with SRAM blocks generated using OpenRAM that will help with optimal resource efficiency. This will allow us to use the high-speed of the TCAM architecture by using SRAM cells which are cheap and power-efficient.

Currently, most of erddapy's functionality is concentrated into a single class, and the URL building features are implemented in that class along with the data transformation methods that process server responses into Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThis project proposes to separate erddapy into core and object (or opinionated) layers. The former will hold the URL building and data transformation functionality, which will be reused by the rest of the library. The latter layer will provide high-level objects that will support a functional API that does not depend on the state of the underlying object (which is the case for the current version of erddapy). This functional API will provide cleaner iterative usage when querying multiple servers and datasets, and new classes implemented in the object layer will support serialization so that they can be pickled and passed on to other processes or machines.\n\nTo execute this project, I delineate two separate aims: refactoring the URL building and data transformation functionality into a new module containing minimal, standalone functions and reusing those functions in the existing primary class; and implementing an additional layer containing the high-level objects that will provide the basis for the functional API. Overall, this will greatly improve the flexibility and scalability of the package, and will help support its wide spectrum of users.",

Some early limitations arising from the necessary limited dimension of sensor spaces have been overcome with the integration of DNN as efficient reducers of large input data. In this project we want to apply RL as an online method to improve an existing grasping algorithm. Using a Kinova Gen3 arm simulated in CoppeliaSIm, that already performs a pick and place operation using a gripper with multiple force and distance sensors, the goal is to improve the current grasping performance by running RL algorithms that learn from the existing algorithm and, eventually, replace it to continue is adaptation to the specificities of the environment. If the experiments proceeds as expected, a second stage will try to transfer the learned controller to the grasping of a new target object in the scene, for example, from a block to a cup.

To ease the transition of RMF Traffic Editor into one that is capable for Autonomous Vehicles (AV), the minimum standard would be for Traffic Editor to match the basic capabilities of the map builders for these simulators.\n\nFrom the LGSVL map annotator, and RoadRunner (CARLA’s map maker), we are able to identify common features that are required for an AV map maker. When we compare it with the existing feature on Traffic Editor, we are able to identify the missing components to work on.\n\nThus, this project aims to create basic features to support AV simulation.

This involves fixing existing bugs, which will also be discovered by creating more examples (and their accompanying documentation). The next step will be implementing a quaternion definition for the child_axis to solve an ambiguity. After fixing the current implementation and documentation the focus will be on adding joints, starting with a planar and cylindrical joint.

It is implemented using a type checker that breaks up the source code into subexpressions and generates their abstract type variables and type relationships to create a constraint system that maps out all of these components of the subexpressions of the source code and helps the compiler deduce the missing concrete type information from this context. These type variables, their interrelationships, and the final type-checked expressions can be printed as debug information to help compiler developers understand this process.

As electronJS makes use of pre-existing business logic, user interface/user experience, and overall web app structure. Apache Airavata is a middleware that makes computation and data analysis easier in a variety of computing environments. The existing SeaGrid desktop application uses Apache Airavata API as a middleware for accessing resources and performing experiments provided by users.

It focuses on how to reuse existing databases and their respective upper layer, rather than creating a new database.

At present, this parser engine can handle SQLs for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, openGauss and Oracle. However, there are still many statements that are not supported yet.\n\nTherefore this project proposes to Solve unsupported Postgres sql about alter statements for ShardingSphere parser and also proofread and optimize the grammar wherever needed.\n\nThe following will be the design/description of work, proofread through DDLStatement.g4 to analyze existing grammars and optimize them (essential), write grammar for unsupported alter statements referring to the official PostgreSQL documentation (essential), implement visit methods for the statements (essential), add new corresponding SQL cases in SQL Cases and expected parsed results in Expected Statement XML (essential), Run SQLParserParameterizedTest and UnsupportedSQLParserParameterizedTest to make sure there are no exceptions (essential).\n\nSuccessful Implementation of the project will add proper support for PostgreSQL Alter Statements ensuring there are no exceptions for the following statements,  ALTER OPERATOR, ALTER POLICY, ALTER PUBLICATION, ALTER ROUTINE, ALTER RULE, ALTER SCHEMA, ALTER SEQUENCE, ALTER SERVER, ALTER STATISTICS, ALTER SUBSCRIPTION, ALTER TABLE, ALTER TEXT SEARCH,ALTER TRIGGER, ALTER TYPE, ALTER VIEW.\n\nThis project will significantly improve the ShardingSphere parser engine.",

To extract the relevant features in log events, the feature extraction technique divides the log data set into finite blocks using a window. A representative approach of supervised learning is used to execute the final anomaly detection process (SVM).

The existing methods in Commons Numbers would be refactored as static functions for use as Lambdas with the new API. The JTransforms library will be integrated for supporting operations such as fast Fourier and Discrete Cosine transforms.

Finally, a results evaluation will be considered using metric measures and comparing the QGAN's performance to the ones of classical machine learning methods.",

A prominent method is the use of autoencoders to search for anomalous events in an unsupervised manner. In project I implement a quantum autoencoder to perform anomaly detection on jet images. The goal is to distinguish QCD jets from anomalous jets with a different production mechanism. I train the quantum autoencoder on standard model data and compare it's performance as an anomaly tagger to a classical autoencoder, to study the potential use of quantum machine learning methods to enhance HEP analyses.",

Despite its great success, the existing image-based methods for particle suffers from data sparsity. Motivated by this question, we plan to represent the particles data in graph and find the most suitable graph representation method in this project. Then, we will build various graph neural networks for end-to-end tau identification with the cutting-edge methods in current graph deep learning research. Furthermore, we will analyze the model performance from multiple perspectives and try to interpret what the networks have learned through training. Lastly, we will benchmark model inference on GPU and provide user guidance through documentation and code. This project will give some insights into the application of Graph Neural Network in tau particle identification and is expected to help the ML4SCI community conduct research in future work.",

However, to run e.g. a robot works cell efficiently, each robot arm has to move independently.\nI have started working on this project last year during an internship at OMRON SINIC X. However, there is still plenty of work to do before this feature is mature enough and compatible with MoveIt's mainstream branch.\nConcrete steps: \n1) Use MoveIt's code standards. \n2) Address the compatibility issue. Define a workflow to allow users to use this new feature without enforcing it on everyone. \n3) Optimize our previous approach to make it faster and safer to use with robots moving at high speeds. \n4) Document the approach, as well as, generate test cases for MoveIt's Continuous Integration system.",

          "description": "With the increase in use of technology and the internet, the risks associated with the internet are also increasing at a very high rate. Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin. I will also add additional features to the plugin.",

Considering processing vast amounts of boundless stream data and doing a  less false positive detection rate is a system engineering challenge that should stand side by side with cybersecurity expert knowledge.  \n \nBuilding state of the art systems required several major components divisions. There are Data Sources (IDS, sys logs, net logs, firewall logs, files) , External intelligence (IOC, SIEM), Processing and detection unit(s)  (batch or streaming processing, deployed ML/DL models) , Data storages (databases, flat files, object storages) and visualizations (index, dashboards).\n \nRecreating each of above divisions are equivalent to reinventing the wheel, therefore openXDR focuses intergaterabiltiy to work with available tools out there which leads users to use existing systems without hassle but with the power of detection and response time of openXDR. In general, it seamlessly integrates with any EDR, NDR, SIEM, or IDS through a modular integrated architecture.",

The current implementation of NodeCloud is a core library that supports AWS, Azure, GCP and DigitalOcean cloud services as extensible plugins, along with an automatic class implementation generator that is built by leveraging the TypeScript compiler API. The aim is to extend this plugin functionality built into NodeCloud to include another emerging cloud provider i.e. Alibaba Cloud, also known as Aliyun, is a cloud computing company, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group.

With growing DevOps tools, it is now a tedious and time-consuming task SREs and developers to continuously monitor their remote applications running inside a multicluster Kubernetes environment. Though there are some great tools using which we can monitor Kubernetes tools there is a need for easy deployment setup and an alerting tool that people can use to get alerts when something goes wrong inside their application running in a Kubernetes environment. It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction. This brings us to address the problem of out of box metrics, traces, events and logs collection for applications running inside Kubernetes, reporting all the collected data on a single dashboard and push notifications to users for critical ones. The collected metrics, traces, events and logs will help to debug the application running inside Kubernetes faster and effectively.",

          "description": "Currently, Casbin uses golang built-in map structure to maintain policies in the main memory and persist the policies via adapter abstraction.\n\nIf policies data grows, however, the growing cost of main memory resources and bad performance make the memory management strategy not tolerable anymore. We need to find a better way to manage the casbin in-memory data when data grows.\n\nFrom my point of view, our main goal is to reduce the cost of memory as well as keep good performance handling policies read and write requests.\n\nIn order to achieve those key goals, we can introduce an experimental tuple storage to get charge of storing those policies, turning the policies management strategy from memory-oriented to disk-oriented. We can even make a better abstraction of the storage layer so that we can use different engines (row, column) for the different workloads.\n\nIn general, we can take the following parts into consideration to achieve our goals.  \n    1. API for upper layer.\n    2. workload optimizer. \n    3. Buffer Pool management.\n    4. Indexing.\n    5. Data Storage Structures.\n    6.

Carefully designed API for upper Casbin internal module.\n    2. Storage management. Include file organization and page layout.\n    3. Buffer pool management.\n    4. Index management.\n    5.

Casdoor is a centralized authentication / Single-Sign-On (SSO) platform.\nProblem: \n1. A more friendly policy management UI is needed for Casbin-dashboard. And it should be able to handle 10,000+ more rules. 2. Test management page needs to be developed for Casbin-dashboard. A test page to make example requests to Casbin and get responses, like Postman. 3. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. Of course authorization will be implemented in Casbin. 4. Casdoor needs to sign up with email without verification by configuring the application edit page. 5. Casdoor needs to support configurable captcha in user flows. It can support different implementations.\nSolution:\n1. We can use more powerful and high-quality UI libraries such as Ant Design to build more friendly web UI. And in order to handle 10,000+ more rules, we can use paging display and virtual list in frontend, and we can use paging query and database index in backend. 2. We can build a test management page, so that we can create and edit our unit test case through the web page. 3. We can build an authorization management page to realize the authorization of the dashboard. We can use Casbin models to control the presentation of every element on the page and control each request of the RESTful API. 4. We can add a rule to control whether the email verification is required.5. We can integrate the different services from cloud captcha providers like gCaptcha, hCaptcha. To save a lot of work, we just only need to integrate the wrapper code.\nDeliverables:\n1. Allow to sign up with Email without verification for Casdoor. - June 7; \n2. Support configurable captcha for Casdoor. - June 28; \n3. A more friendly policy management UI for Casbin-dashboard. - July 11; \n4. Test management page for Casbin-dashboard. - July 23; \n5.

Using Simulink code generation tools to add a custom attitude controller to the ArduPilot will allow the researcher to test their novel control algorithm in ArduPilot without spending too much time in manual coding which will further increase ArduPilot usage in academia. \n\nCurrently, ArduPilot does not have a short and concise way to implement and test custom controllers. This project’s main aim is to create a systematic and sustainable way to implement a custom controller into ArduPilot using Simulink code generation and set an example for other researchers on how to use ArduPilot as a control system development platform. \n\nI implemented a new controller in the ArduCopter and has a Simulink model of this controller, thus I will continue with this vehicle type. But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it. Last, prepare detailed documentation and video to show how to utilize this functionality.",

          "description": "Premature birth is highly prevalent with every one in ten births being premature. A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",

When new astrophysicists start using the Tardis, they would use the help of the past projects to understand the simulated spectra. So it is important to continuously update the simulated spectra of past projects as the code of Tardis gets modified. \nCurrently, there are 3 past projects which are stored in the tardis-setups repository. Each time there is a change in the codebase of Tardis, it is hard to manually run the projects and update the spectra. So a CI/CD framework should be created to automate comparing and publishing the results. To achieve this, we intend to use a combination of Github Actions and Azure Pipelines. Azure Pipelines will be used to perform the actual calculations and obtain the graphs since they provide more computing power. On the other hand, GitHub Actions will be used to publish the results.\nThe existing projects have different ways to run the simulations.

          "description": "Documentation refers to the additional text associated with a codebase to help developers and/or clients/users understand the code/use cases better.  Documentation is of two types - 1) Documentation within the code and 2) Documentation about the code. Ruby supports the generation of documentation for a particular codebase using comments written internally in files by tools such as RDoc, and YARD. RBS is a newly developed language for describing the structure of Ruby programs. RBS, similar to Ruby, supports adding comments in the source file. Hence, this feature can be effectively utilized to write encoded inline documentation to later generate well-formatted markup documentation. RBS currently has support for a lot of features. RBS can find its arguably best application in generating typed documentation of a particular codebase.",

          "description": "Data is the new big thing for search engines in today’s time but it can be difficult for web crawlers to effectively interpret the context of the data. To deliver better search results, web crawlers need to have a context of the data and to understand the data better, structured data is used. Structured data is the data which conforms to a data model, has a well defined structure, follows a consistent order and can be easily accessed and used by a person or a computer program. It is used by search engines to generate rich snippets, which are small pieces of information that will then appear in search results making the search results more relevant.\nCurrently Joomla! has rich snippets implemented but it uses inline microdata to implement rich snippets which is difficult to modify from the backend as it is hard coded into the html. With this project I’ll be working on to making it easier for the user to dynamically integrate structured data from the backend. \nFor the dynamic integration of structured data I’ll be using schema.org which provides a universally recognized format for structuring data on the Web. There are different ways to implement schema markup but for this project I’ll be using JSON-LD as it can be inserted into the web page without disrupting other contents or HTML and it is easy to store in the database. This project will help user to add, update or delete schema markup on the articles from the backend. It will give user an option to select the type of schema from the available schema types and then insert values for the attributes of schema properties in the form. Some useful data which is already present in other forms will be fetched using AJAX Interface and it will be directly inserted into the JSON object. After saving the article, the generated schema will be pushed into the head element of the page.",

Forward edge attacks (through function pointers and virtual calls) were proven to be less accessible after implementing Control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. However, backward edge attacks easily bypass present instrumentation (Safe Stacks, canaries).\n\nUnder these circumstances, shadow stacks become more than necessary: shadow stacks are a defense mechanism that require metadata about the program’s state to enforce their policies. They protect the return value of the functions by comparing what’s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage. \n\nMy project will consist of comparing different implementations of shadow stacks with their advantages and disadvantages, crafting a compelling PR, that would perfectly fit Unikraft's vision regarding modularization and portability and a clear discussion of the overhead brought by such an approach.",

          "description": "At the moment, Unikraft can leverage a single processor only. While there can be multiple threads (i.e., multiprogramming), no two activities actually run at the same time (i.e., multiprocessing). Unikraft introduces support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), thereby allowing it to execute code on all processors and cores of a system concurrently. This creates new challenges for synchronizing access to shared resources. On a single-processor machine synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores can consider interrupts as the only source of parallel execution. It is thus sufficient to protect a critical section of code by temporarily disabling interrupts. With SMP, however, this is no longer sufficient as other processors may access shared resources at any time.\nThe project will involve studying locking mechanisms used in modern kernels like Linux, FreeBSD, etc, improving the existing locking mechanisms in unikraft, and implementing new mechanisms such as read-write. The important part of the project will be identifying the critical sections present in the kernel and protecting these critical sections.",

It will enable SGX support for Unikraft, which provides strong isolation between SGX-protected contents and others. My plan is divided into 6 tasks:\n1. Deploy SGX-related environment for QEMU and KVM\n2. Let Unikraft be capable of being aware of SGX at boot time by checking corresponding CPUID flags.\n3. Enable a very simple unikraft application (say helloworld) in SGX, without paging support by porting corresponding libraries and implementing the SGX drivers.\n4. Enable paging for SGX applications in Unikraft.\n5. Try to port a complex application like sqlite3 into Unikraft with SGX support to check if there is any bug or issue to be solved.\n6.

          "description": "A key challenge surrounding modern bioinformatics is to manage and store the growing amount of biological data with both space efficiency and scalability. Traditionally, biological data are often stored as human-readable flat files or as entries in a conventional relational database. However, a drawback of such approaches is that the space required to maintain these data is becoming increasingly unmanageable, significantly reducing the scalability. Additionally, along with the size of the database, the time to query the database also increases. As stated in the problem statement, on Ensembl, homology data are currently stored as tuples in a relational database, resulting in the whole database being large and hard to scale. A natural way to compactly store the data is to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of homology relationships. We propose multiple hierarchical data structures and formatting methods to improve the space efficiency of homology databases as well as important metrics to consider when designing such data structures and formats. We propose these potential approaches with the application in actual gene homology databases in mind. As part of the project, we will implement the representations using Python and/or C++ and evaluate them using proposed metrics.",

But it has limitations that it can still not recognize many entities of predefined classes due to being trained on a dataset having less training data in natural language form and less generalized RegEx/string matching rules. Also, due to the poor entity normalization approach, many extracted entities are being ignored in the final output stage of the pipeline. \n\nThis project proposal aims to increase the entity detection capabilities of this “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system by firstly integrating additional RegEx/string matching rules in the current pipeline. Secondly, by combining other training datasets with the existing IDP4 dataset and then extending this combined training dataset using active learning to capture more data classes in natural language form. Lastly, re-training the current BioBERT model using a modified approach and making the entity standardization approach more general and scalable. Along with improving entity recognition of existing data classes, this proposal also aims to extend the current “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system to extract data classes related to the CRISPR-cas9 experiment.",

In order to achieve this the following are the main tasks for the project:\n\nFirst, creating a Back End for Fetching Data (BE Read): To create a GraphQL Server which will make it easy to fetch the required data using advanced operations like join and aggregations by making a single API call to the Back End.\n\nSecond, creating a Front End for Fetching Data (FE Read): To create a UI for selecting which data is to be fetched.\n\nHence using a GraphQL Server, user only needs to make a single API call, and with a better UI, user wont have to worry about writing queries for fetching data.\n\n\nDeliverables : \n\n1. Basic Fetching of documents (single and multiple documents of an elasticsearch index)\n2. Implementing Dataloader in the GraphQL server for decreasing DB hits\n3.

It has led to inconsistencies in the UI of mojaglobal projects and as an organization, all the projects that are coming under it must have a common theme and design to ensure user interest.\n\nAlso whenever a new project starts the developer has to make all the components by himself/herself from the start, and if in the future one component has to be changed then we will have to change it in each project if we do not have UI Library.\n\nAll these things will be achieved by developing a faster, lightweight, user-friendly, mobile-friendly, and cross-browser-compatible UI library as a stand-alone dependency for moja global projects.\n\nI welcome this opportunity to work on building a UI Library for moja global. I like the idea of building a UI library having pre-written or ready-made code for various widely used components across all the repositories of moja global that future developers and users can use in their projects just by installing the package and running two or three import commands.",

Our goal is to detect the transition between the consecutive shots and at the same time to identify the type of cut (e.g. gradual, abrupt). Compared to the majority of the existing works, we aim to work on historical films, with damaged or low-quality video data, which makes the cuts identification task particularly challenging.

The two-stage pipeline will begin with feature filtering using pre-trained classifiers and heuristic-based approaches. This stage will produce noisy title sequence segmented data containing audio, video, and possibly text. These extracted multimedia snippets will then be passed to the second pipeline stage. In the second stage, the extracted features from the multimedia snippets will be clustered using RNN-DBSCAN. Title sequence detection is possibly the most efficient path to high precision segmentation for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection (which have fairly structured recordings). This detection algorithm may not bode well for the more unstructured V8+ and V4 VCR tapes in the Rosenthal collection. Therefore the goal is to produce accurate video cuts and split metadata results for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection.",

Massive textual corpora – such as those created from social media data – and the tools and theories of corpus linguistics enable researchers to track patterns of linguistic entrenchment. Meanwhile, the theory of frame semantics in cognitive linguistics offers a framework for understanding how particular linguistic units help language users conceptualize broader experiential or abstract scenes. By integrating frame semantic parsing into the analysis of divergent entrenchment of linguistic units between social clusters within a social media discourse, we can potentially derive observations about divergent conceptualization of a given topic.",

There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation by up to 90%, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks.

The first step would be to develop a baseline model using existing pre-trained deep learning models and add to the Red Hen’s pipeline. Then the performance can be improved using transfer learning and fine tuning the existing model to achieve better accuracy.

Our proposed architecture lies on two neural networks, the Compact Transformer and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Compact Transformer which is the current State-of-the-art structure for temporally distributed images also performs well over low-resourced data.

          "description": "Shot Boundary Detection of films is an important task that is mostly performed manually. There are some available tools and existing research which tend to automate the process. However, in the case of old archival films, available tools fail to detect most of the shot boundaries. State-of-the-art research performs quite well in detecting these boundaries, but these methods come with high time complexity and are not feasible to use in real life. In this work, an efficient and accurate shot boundary detection is proposed which should work well with archival films. The proposed tool will be built upon the existing work 'FilmEditDetection', which is developed during the last summer of code. The proposed tool should be able to detect the shot boundaries, which the previous tool fails to detect, without compromising the time complexity of the entire tool. This is achieved by using a machine learning-based framework on top of the cut detection module(Siamese Network). Few new features are also to be added to the tool - Average Shot Length, Comparison of individual shot lengths, etc. The current version of the tool is based on CLI. A graphical user interface can be developed based on the tool for simplicity of use.",

In previous years, outreach and accessibility updates have been core goals of the showcase, so this project aims to expand the possibilities of how outreach and accessibility can be achieved.\r\n\r\nSubmissions will be encouraged to interpret the theme BONDS in their own ways, with emphasis on community, care, and thoughtfulness. As well, the ability to participate in and browse the showcase should not be hindered by one’s physical abilities, thus increasing accessibility will further BOND the community, especially in the parts of the community that are not as well represented.\r\n\r\nThis project will deliver three stages of changes: the community approach, the support, and the narrative. The community approach will implement a hashtag and social media challenge to expand community discussion/bonding beyond the showcase launch date. The support phase will focus on tweaking specific functions to greatly improve UI and accessibility, as good design will open up the p5 community/showcase to underrepresented communities, such as the impaired. Lastly, the narrative phase will introduce the implementation of an \"Explore\" tab alongside of the current \"Gallery\" tab, which will encompass a digital gallery that allows viewers to freely explore the works and create their own narratives, adding more personality/personal voice to each submission.",

          "description": "My proposal is to resolve a number of outstanding bugs with WebGL functionality in p5.js, as well as expand on the documentation and tests for that functionality. While the WebGL components of p5.js are increasingly robust, there are a number of open issues that point towards some unexpected behavior and a lack of documentation around certain features. There is also the challenge of structuring the WebGL functions in a way that achieves parity with the p5.js approach to 2d rendering. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of bugs that I would like to resolve, including #5455, #5631, and #5440. For documentation, it seems necessary to make certain additions to better orient developers who are new to 3D graphics and shaders, including graphics quirks that go beyond p5.js, such as the depth sorting challenges mentioned in issue #5420. I would also like to contribute documentation that helps users better understand the structure of WebGL in p5.js, information that is currently only available within the contributor documents. Additional examples would also be helpful for topics like setting up an effects chain or for achieving certain effects such as feedback.",

          "description": "The Problem:\n\nThere's no IAM System for Payment Hub.\n\nWhy is this a problem? \n\nAs of now, we have to deal with authenticating each user for every application. Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. \n\nGoal: \n\nIntegrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub.\n\nProject Impact:\n\nCurrently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts:\n- Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access.\n- Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. \n- Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.\n\nDeliverables: \n\nThe deliverables are divided into three main tasks, namely,\n- Token Introspection\n- Scope Check\n- OAuth MTLS",

          "description": "“Wagtail provides a field type for semi-freeform data, StreamField, which uses a JSON representation to store \"blocks\" of data.” A major problem developers using StreamField come across is writing data migrations when making changes involving blocks in the StreamField, which can easily become very complicated when nested blocks and multiple blocks are involved. This project involves making a set of reusable utility functions for going through different types of StreamField structures and applying changes, as well as ready made high level functions for common use cases of StreamField related data migrations and a way to generate corresponding migration files. It could be extended to deal with live and draft revisions of pages too.",

          "description": "The goal of the project is to develop reusable building blocks for visual exploration of Internet data. The building blocks will be developed in the ObservableHQ platform, which uses the popular visualization library D3.js. The building blocks will be open-source code, published as templates in the ObservableHQ platform. Any user would be able to fork/copy a template and plug their own data, and/or modify it according to their needs. Since the code will be in D3.js, the building blocks can be re-usable by any javascript component, not only in ObservableHQ. The targeted users mainly are Internet researchers and network. There exist various types of Internet data, mainly, tabular data (e.g., ASN or latency value), timeseries (e.g., AS hegemony per day), graphs (e.g., routing graph), paths (e.g., traceroutes, BGP paths). We will create at least one building block that can visualize each type of data. Different types of data need different types of visualizations. We will consider a range of visualizations, such as, sankey diagrams (very useful to visualize relations, paths, etc. in Internet data), graphs, geo-maps, distribution plots (e.g., histograms, violin plots), dendrograms, heatmaps.",

          "description": "The audience of IHR largely consists of researchers, network operators, policymakers, and educators. The goal of the proposal is to make the IHR’s internet application an end-to-end solution for stakeholders to work on. Currently, the IHR website provides plots of internet latency and routing for AS and countries. The goal of this software subsystem is to add new plots showing speed test data collected by Measurement-Lab so that users can monitor how disconnections and routing events impact throughput. While providing the users with a quick lookup for the NDT test it becomes immensely important to co-relate IHR traffic analysis with Google and Cloudflare reports. Collecting data from similar services would also pump IHR’s anomaly detector to complement IHR’s alerting system. With IHR the hub for multiple network reports and metrics, it is vital to have a dashboard to customize visual data. I propose to develop a customized IHR dashboard that is self-exploratory. The dashboard would let end users explore the IHR dataset and monitor any event with respect to time and legends according to their purpose. The dashboard would let the user select a set source and destination networks, time periods, and a metric and correspondingly plot the data. Ultimately, adding an assistant to select a set of important networks from a selected country or global statistics about the plotted data.",

          "description": "The basic features in an Election DApp are user registration, election creation, voting and result calculation. To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity.  There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as \"Extend Election Dates\", \"Restrict Past Dates\", \"Logout functionality\", \"Profile Edit\", and \"Improve the UI\".",

It will also implement a quota system to prevent abuse of computing resources.\nThis will be accomplished by using a predefined SSH connection to the facility. Instead of user holding the private key and moving the public key to the remote submit node, the server holds a database of all remote nodes and for each node it creates a separate public and private key pair.  The public key will be copied to the remote node. The private key would be saved on the server. Whenever an authenticated user tries to connect to a particular submit node in the HPC facility, the private key for that node will be fetched by the server and will be used to authenticate the user against that remote node and there will be no need for the user to configure and enter any private key at all. Thus there will be just one private key for all users of a particular submit node. Server will also keep a tally of all the users that are currently using the server's private key at the moment. This will help implement a quota system to ensure that the resources are not maxed out.\nOver the span of 12 weeks, a customized version of cloud COPASI will be produced that will provide an easy to use interface for UConn users to submit their jobs and get results in quick time.",

What I seek to implement in this project is a way to directly convert\nSBOL3 to GenBank, without any intermediate file formats.\nThe final goal is to have a set of test GenBank files generated from conversion and implement unit tests for the same.",

The proposed updates include the addition of new analysis features (more specifically, the ability to support weighted nodes in community detection and to parameterize the sizes of returned modules), and making netboxr more widely available to researchers via the Galaxy platform. Additionally, time-permitting, a pipeline for processing datasets from the cBioPortal using netboxr should also be created. The end product of this mini-project will be a research proposal, which, as per published GSoC proposal instructions, will include a demonstrated understanding (including code samples) of what steps are involved in making a Galaxy tool, an explanation of igraph community detection methods, and an analysis of different sets of data from the cBioPortal conducted using netboxr given the instructions in the tutorial.",

Conversion to SBML format from SBGN or SIF is lossy since the data models are not fully compatible. Information may be lost during conversion to SBML format. This is why supporting the SBML format in Newt is crucial. The main feature proposed to be implemented is for users to create SBML models from scratch in Newt without the need to convert them to other data formats.

          "description": "Print Dialogs are one of the most used features for many people, and it is important that they stay up to date with the current print technologies (like CUPS) and be able to quickly adopt any new such upcoming technology (XYZ Cloud Printing Service). The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on.\n\nAs of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles.\n\nThe Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia.\n\n\nThis project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",

Printers that do not do driverless IPP need to be set up manually in the supported Printer Applications.

The idea is to create a GUI tool for the user which lists available, non-IPP-driverless printers, local (USB) and network devices and then set up printers in supported Printer Applications.",

          "description": "The CHAOSS community develops metrics, practices, and software for measuring open source software community health and sustainability. Augur and Grimoirelab are two powerful open source community health analytics projects supporting the CHAOSS mission. In particular, each has implementation of select metrics based on an expanding set of implementation-agnostic metric definitions associated with various focus areas.\n\nThe CHAOSS Metrics Model Working group defines metric models, which integrate multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that makes it easy for end users such as community managers to get a more comprehensive measure of an open source community. Currently, Conversion Rate can be defined as a metric or metric model. It measures the rates at which new contributors to an open source project move through the \"contributor funnel\" toward sustained contribution and/or community maintainership. There is no implementation of the Conversion Rate metric or metric model in CHAOSS software yet.\n\nThis project aims to build a novel implementation of Conversion Rate as a metric model that is based on a minimum number of atomic metrics and has maximum reuse of existing implemented metrics as well as common metric model calculation code supporting all types of conversion rates. A simple config file based UI for entering parameters and filters by the users is all it takes to run the metric model. \n\nNew metrics will be implemented first in Jupyter Notebook as reference code and can later migrate into Grimoirelab backend (for sharing with future new metric models or reports) along with data collection and enrichment extensions. The Metric Model calculation code and methods, and a common visualization interface will be also implemented in Jupyter Notebook, followed by a deployment with OpenSearch Dashboards visualization.",

It also provides editing pages and guidelines for feature developers to enter and view the process of their features. The app currently has a traditional multi-page application design in which each URL corresponds to a HTML file, and almost every click in the site triggers a loading of the new page.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to upgrade the website into a single-page application for better user experience. This requires the use of web components for client-side rendering and state management. All the current HTML templates would be converted into the Lit components and managed by a new top-level component, which would also have a router to manage the routing of the whole app. In addition, parts of the server code that return HTML elements upon API requests would have to be redesigned. This project will make the codebase of the app much more maintainable and scalable, and allow for a more fluent user experience on ChromeStatus.com.",

          "description": "Switching to Conscrypt, simulating the security APIs becomes much more high-fidelity and it achieves the goal of Robolectric to make it similar to an Android environment.\n\nCurrently, Robolectric uses BouncyCastle as the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) security provider. Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt.\n\nAs it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt.\n\nThe Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. \n \nConscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. \n\nConscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code.

They are as follows.\n\n -> Displaying count of contents of a directory in the size column  \n\nCurrently, the value under the size column for directories are left blank. The aim is to enable a feature, that\nshows the count of folders/files within a directory under the size column, which the user can toggle from the\ncolumn editor. We have a WIP patch to work upon.\n\n-> Add the option to expand folders in “Details View”\n\nCurrently, upon entering a folder, details-view lists all the contents of a folder without the ability to expand\nthe contents of each folder on the same view. This project seeks to enable the expansion of folders on the\nsame view. This will allow the user to quickly list the files/folders within a directory without needing to\ndescend into a folder. The user would thus, be able to retain a better sense of position while working on a\ndirectory.\n\n-> Add User profiles to XFCE Terminal and rewrite its preferences dialog\n\nThis project seeks to enable user profiles in XFCE Terminal. Currently, all the settings for the terminal are global. Any changes made to the settings will reflect on all the open windows and tabs.\n\nUser profiles enable the user to store a particular set of settings as a preset which can be easily retrieved and applied (preferably using hotkeys) to a given terminal instance of their choice.\n\nThe preference dialog was built using glade. Glade is, in general, unpleasant to work with which has led a lot of other Xfce apps to build their UI through code. Additionally, this makes it difficult to embed the XfceShortcutsEditor into the dialog.\n\nSince, the preference dialog would need to be redesigned for this project, manually rewriting the dialog in C would have the added benefit of embedding XfceShortcutsEditor.",

          "description": "The 2010s decade marked a beginning for widespread compiler testing with the release of programs like Csmith, a C program generator that since its release has found and reported over 400 compiler bugs. However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones.\nHephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years.\nHephaestus detects bugs by:\n1.\tgenerating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract\n2.\tgenerating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference\n3.\tusing translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",

          "description": "Apothesis is an open-source software that allows the simulation of thin film deposition processes via the Kinetic Monte Carlo method. Thin-film deposition is an important manufacturing step in the production of many opto-electronic, solid-state and medical devices and products, including consumer electronics, semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, LED displays, optical filters, compound semiconductors, precision optics, microscopy & microanalysis sample slides, and medical implants. The computational simulation of thin-film deposition can offer insight into deposition processes and guide the development of technologies that streamline or enhance the thin film deposition process. Therefore, Apothesis can be a valuable tool for scientists and engineers working in this field. \nHowever, Apothesis’ applicability to many problems and popularity is severely limited by the settings (species growth/deposition geometries, processes) that can be specified by the user and the very specific input format (JSON format) that is not widely used in the scientific community.

This robot will have a compact design with little or no expandability in order for the students to engage more in the robot’s programming and understand various concepts. For that reason, we will have to ensure the robot’s resilience to avoid accidents and make it durable.\nApart from that, I plan on developing use-case scenarios in greek, ready to use by the teachers, including course objectives and possible extensions for each one.It would be nice to also develop extensive and simple guidelines of how to print and assemble the robot for everyone to follow, despite their technological background.\n\nSince we want the students to focus on programming and learning to develop their own algorithms, it is important to develop an easy-to-use, kids-friendly environment, preferably a desktop app, integrating Google’s Blockly. During the last GSoC, an API system was developed, so that using Blockly is expected to be easy. So, I would love to connect both the compact version and the full one with Scratch/Blockly following ELLAK ‘s aesthetics, like this existing prototype. The app should be colourful and have an interactive design, specially designed for students, also having multiple pop ups and information about their actions and whether they were successful or not. I would like to turn programming into a fun activity, so that the children can learn while having fun.\nHowever, since Blockly’s integration requires modifying the core library, I plan on rewriting some parts of the Raspberry Pi’s code  concerning movement control.

This Wiki/Documentation proposed will cover everything that you need to start designing integrated circuits from scratch. Some amount of knowledge of Linux/Bash is assumed.  \n\n\nI want to elevate the pressure on Skywater’s slack as the base for discussion for issues by adding a troubleshooting guide. This will allow mentors in slack to have one go-to point for all of the most common issues that they can refer to.  \n\n\nAll of the tutorials and demos are text + screenshots posted on GitHub. This is because it’s easier to update them when new versions of software come out or if the existing guide does not cover a particular topic. Videos get outdated every 3-6 months and require an effort from contributors to support. The aim is to reduce the cost of documentation support.  \n\n\nAll documentation will be proposed to developers of the according to software to be integrated into existing software’s documentation.

          "description": "The problem I am solving:\nThe existing HDF5 asynchronous I/O feature supports the C/C++ interface. This project involves the development and performance evaluation of a Python interface that would allow more Python-based scientific codes to use and benefit from the asynchronous I/O.\nThe h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5 library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete wrapping of the HDF5 API.\nThe h5py package currently only supports synchronous I/O. And this project I am going to add the Asynchronous I/O.\n\nThe plan to solve it:\nMilestone 1: create a new Python API.\nMilestone 2: convert existing c tests to python tests.\nMilestone 3: test my implementation with the tests.\nMilestone 4: evaluate the performance with a scientific python application.\nWhen all tests pass we will have a usable Python interface for the asynchronous I/O.\n\nAn example: the H5Fcreate_async function:\nFirst, prepare the H5Fcreate_async.h file, H5Fcreate_async.c file, and we create the cyH5Fcreate_async.pyx file. \nSecond, use the command to Parse pyx source code into c code. \nNext, use some commands to compile c files into object files (*.o files)\nNext, use some commands to link multiple object files into dynamic link library files (*.so files)\nIn this way, the file of H5Fcreate_async.so is obtained, and then the library can be imported in the Python application.",

As the number of conversations and messages increase, maintaining an index on the client side becomes tougher.\n \nThe solution to these problems is a Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme that lets the client safely store an encrypted database on an untrusted server and search through it with full privacy.\n \nThis project will implement, in particular, the keyword search scheme outlined in a Demertzis et al. paper titled “Fast Searchable Encryption with Tunable Locality”. I will achieve this by creating a Python library that exposes methods to create, update and search on encrypted indices stored in content repositories in a Matrix homeserver.\n \nAs a part of the project I will be demonstratively integrating the library into an existing Matrix client.

For instance, family pictures are not meant to be uploaded to Commons.

Evaluation, mockups, code-complete implementation, testing, and documentation of the individual elements such as labels, links, and images as well as composite components such as headers, footers and pagination will be performed.\n\nThe project ensures creating a consistent framework with an exhaustive three-step workflow:\n1. Inventory/Evaluation Phase: Variations in individual elements and composite components from each website are recorded to ensure all alternates are captured.\n\n2. Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders.\n\n3. Implementation and Testing Phase: The final approved mockup will be implemented in TailwindCSS. The element/component will be documented and tested.

          "description": "Transforming electrophysiology signals from sensors into their frequency representations has been shown to be a way to increase the power for application of this data; for one example of very many see Swann et al., 2015. This Fourier-transformed sensor data can be used to infer data within the brain in a very similar way as the time-series data but with an added, fifth dimension for frequency. MNE-Python has all the components necessary for time-frequency source estimate viewing and would be greatly improved by integrating them to allow for exploration of this complex data. A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to look at regions of high power spectral density, while letting the user dynamically adjust the range of frequencies, would be incredibly helpful for allowing this kind of data to be explored and analyzed. The ability to browse slices has already been implemented in `mne.gui.ieeg_locate` and could be abstracted to be used in this case. Time-frequency plotting of spectrograms, with appropriate units and baseline correction already exists in MNE-Python as well. Putting these elements together into a GUI would be a great improvement for the MNE-Python tool and community.",

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years.\n\nThis project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to.\n\nSince “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",

          "description": "AF_XDP is an address family that is optimized for high performance packet processing. AF_XDP redirects raw network packets to user mode through the XDP program. AF_XDP, like DPDK, can be used to bypass the Linux kernel to gain high-performance processing network packets.  DNSDist acts as a load balancer and often needs to process and forward packets. Therefore, in order to forward DNS requests DNSDist needs the raw network packets processed by the Linux kernel network protocol stack, read its request, and send the same request to the downstream DNS server again through the Linux kernel network protocol stack. The repeated processing of the same or similar data by the Linux kernel network stack is an unnecessary overhead for the server deploying DNSDist. This overhead can be effectively avoided by bypassing the Linux kernel through AF_XDP.",

It reduces the latency introduced by TCP and also is reliable and secure than UDP.\n\nThe idea is to implement and add the support of DNS over QUIC (DoQ) to DNSDist, which is an application written in C++ and sits between the DNS backend servers and clients as an intelligent load balancer capable of filtering DoS attacks.\n\nTo complete the project, I need to go through the existing implementation which has been done and proceed with the development of modules which handle incoming and outgoing DNS requests using DoQ.

This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example.\n\nDeliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",

I've divided the problem into the following 5 milestones, with their subtasks to achieve: 1. Merging Projects Components with existing, simple conflicting variables protocol: 1.1 Merging Multiple Sprites 1.2 Merging Scenes 2. Implementing a Manual Conflict-Handler Interface: 2.1 User Interface for Merging Dialog: (choosing which conflict to merge, option to abort merge etc.) 2.2 Handling Local & Global Variable Conflicts 2.3 Handling Script Conflicts: View of Conflicting Scripts, Choose One 2.4 Handling Looks & Sounds Conflicts: Duplication User chooses 2.5 Handling Equal Sprites 2.6 Handling Equal Scenes 3. Merging options for UI 3.1 Abort Merge 3.2 Automatic Merge Without Conflict Search ( may not import everything) 3.3 Manual Merge ( Powerful Merge every conflict needs to be resolved) 4. Device specific configurations 4.1 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive variables 4.2 Handling Screen Size & Resolution sensitive bricks 5. Merging Remix Graph 5.1 Implementing project merge history Each feature will be implemented using Kotlin or Java depending on source code files affected by changes, and each feature should be well tested.",

          "description": "## **Project Proposal**\n\nCBioPortal has extensive tutorials on how to use the site, but they are in video formats which is not ideal. \n\n### Overview\n\nIn this project, I aim to make a framework for creating “tour like tutorials” which are interactive for any part of the site. Through this, it will not only be easier for the user to be on-boarded but also simple for developers to add tours for the new features they implement.\n\n### Proposed UX\n\nIf the user is new to a feature/page or completely new to the portal, the flow is as follows:\n\n1. The introduction tutorial is triggered automatically and an option to play appears.\n2. The relevant steps are loaded and played through react-tour.\n3. User is notified of the /tutorials page in-case they want to replay the tour.\n\nIf the user wants to play a tour manually, the flow is as follows:\n\n1. User clicks on a relevant tutorial on the tutorials page.\n2. React-Tour is triggered with relevant steps for the tutorial.\n3. The user plays through the tutorial.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nTo do this, I propose a simple system where all the **steps** for each tutorial are stored in JSON format which is readable by the [react-tour](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactour) package. On playing a particular tutorial, our code will read in the relevant steps and pass it to the react-tour component to run.\n\nAdditionally, I would add functionality to trigger this tour through code if needed. This way, new features can be shown to the user without the user needing to click on tutorials manually.\n\nThe JSON can also be lazy-loaded as needed if there are a lot of tours as it might increase the network usage of a user.",

As Tiled offers better room editing features than Game Maker, adding Tiled compatibility to Enigma can help users take advantage of Tiled room editor along with Enigma’s development environment. This project also expects some research to know the intermediate representation of Tiled in much more detail.\nTMX is a Tiled specific room format and EGM is an Enigma specific project format. Most of the features supported by EGM format are based on Game Maker’s format GMX. The way this project aims to achieve Tiled compatibility is twofold. First part consists of adding a TMX importer to Enigma while the second part consists of adding an EGM importer to Tiled. Additional tasks involve analyzing GMX 1.4 to understand various protocol buffer fields, adding Gtests in libEGM to check correctness of deserializer efficiently.",

          "description": "Taxonomies are an easy way to classify information into various categories. In Open Food Facts, taxonomies are used for classification, translation and linkage to useful properties such as nutri-score and allergens. Hence, taxonomies play a vital role in the Open Food Facts database and must be maintained properly.\n\nIn Open Food Facts, each taxonomy is in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, where each leaf node has one or more parent nodes. There are conventions for indicating parent and child nodes. Product Opener has been using a text file for taxonomies, as it is an efficient and quick way for storing information. But, the files present in Open Food Facts are very long and thus, very cumbersome to edit by contributors.\n\nThe goal of this project is to alleviate this issue, by introducing a Taxonomy Editor. This tool would help contributors to quickly visualize the hierarchy of components in the taxonomy. It would enable fast search of a particular element and allow visualization of the element with multilingual synonyms as well. The visualization will include any inherited properties of the element too. The tool will authorize CRUD of properties, names and synonyms, within a taxonomy and will validate the taxonomy for errors such as duplicates and cycles. The tool would be able to figure out the consequences of a modification done to a taxonomy. This feedback would help contributors to understand how their changes might possibly bring any errors or unwanted side-effects.\n\nThe introduction of Taxonomy Editor will be very beneficial, as it will help to visualize how products are classified and would encourage more contributions from the wonderful community of contributors of Open Food Facts.\n\nDeliverables: Creation of a backend for parsing taxonomies, Provision for quick search of a component, Implement CRUD of elements in a taxonomy, Build hierarchy visualizations for taxonomies, Implementing validation of a taxonomy modification",

Offline Edit Mode\n    After being done with the above two works, the 3rd and most important phase will be \n    Carried out. A clean and working mechanism to store the changes locally will be\n    Discussed with the mentors and start the work on the same to store the changes and \n    Sync those changes when online and delete the offline changes so as to keep the app\n    as lightweight as possible.\n\n4. Preloading Data\n    If time persists and the above work is done(which i am sure will be done), add a \n    mechanism to preload the data as cache (as step 2) so as to let the users use the app\n    For popular food items in their country out of the box\n\n4.

          "description": "The stakeholders of Open Food Facts consist of food consumers, food producers, government organizations, scientists and researchers. They all have different purposes for using OFF but the game-changer is data. All the data collected can be used for research, deciding the best health policies, and even to make better-informed food choices for people all around the globe. The Hunger Games leverage the results of the OCR used in OFF to validate more data and annotate new things to help train machine-learning models. The aim of this proposal is to add many more features and improve the UI as well as UX to retain contributors. Retaining contributors would ultimately, increase the labelling of data, resulting in better clusterisation and hence a more efficient model in terms of accuracy.\n\nTo get data and statistics about the contributions made by the volunteers, we need to assure that they have proper credentials and are logged in to OFF. But users tend to bounce back from the website if they have to directly create an account without knowing what the software does. The Hunger Games is mildly addictive and fun to play, so I propose to prompt users after say 10 questions to log in or sign up. \n\nMoreover, I plan to integrate the OFF-events leaderboard, badges, and more into the hunger games application which will create a metaverse environment for OFF. I will also add levels that will give the users a strong sense of satisfaction. To improve the usability of mobile devices, modify the hunger games into a PWA. Developing a PWA would reduce network calls in total hence, reduce the bounce back and idle period for the contributors before their period. \n\nIn addition to that, I plan to add new features like profile pages for contributors to showcase achievements, giving options for undoing the user’s actions, reporting and providing feedback to OFF, more autocompletion and filters, and so on. All these features will provide a pathway to having more reliable data.",

          "description": "Industry Foundation Class (IFC) is the leading open data format for the built environment, based on the ISO 16739-1:2018 standard. It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data.\n\n\nBlender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process.\n\n\nAn equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible.\n\n\nSome of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case. Since the IFC schema is very large, and often difficult to grasp for new users, emphasis will be on integrating the concepts of IFC into a typical design process in a natural manner and communicating the relevant information comprehensively to the user.",

This is so common a task that even small inefficiencies add up. This project aims to make this task more convenient by integrating energy readers for output files of a number of MD engines into the auxiliary data framework of MDAnalysis. An in-depth tutorial of how future auxiliary data readers can be written, based on the lessons learned in this project, will also be provided to assist further development of this system of MDAnalysis.",

Niffler acquires images from the PACS in real-time (meta-extraction) and on-demand (cold-extraction), then extracts DICOM metadata into a Mongo database or a CSV file, and performs computations on the metadata to compute utilization metrics for the scanners. This project performs the computations for the MR scanners, although it can be used for any modality. However, these computations were largely limited to the study level - how frequently a scanner idled between studies and how long it took for a scanner to perform a given study. Computing those metrics in a finger granularity, at the series level, is more challenging since the start time and end time of a series is harder to find with just public DICOM headers.\nFurthermore, while this project has a scanner utilization computed in the backend, there is no integrated front-end to present the results elegantly. The created results are currently stored in CSV files and displayed through an Eaglescope dashboard. The front-end can be improved with better integration.",

There are numerous methods, models, and algorithms for data cleaning processes that might be categorized under imputation, outlier detections, formatting, and visualizations among others. The process of evaluating these methods for a given dataset is challenging considering the volume of the dataset and the time/space complexities of the methods. Automation of the performance evaluation process can lead to a significant reduction in human efforts and time consumption with an unbiased comparison environment. \n\nThe imputeTestbench package provides a benchmarking tool for automated performance evaluation and comparison of various imputation methods for time-series datasets. In its present form, the package is capable of handling time-series and temporal datasets. Imputation plays a crucial role in the fields of genetics and genomics. The aforementioned package can be very helpful if it can be modified to handle genetic or genomics datasets. It has huge potential in handling genetic/ genomics datasets and introducing parallel-processing and high-performance computing concepts.\n\nConsidering these as a motivation, the goal of the project is to develop a new R package, modifying the imputeTestbench package for Genomics applications with better computational capabilities and will be named 'imputeTestbenchG'.",

          "description": "The main idea of IQS in digiKam is to determine the quality of an image and convert it into a score. This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence,  we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use",

          "description": "PROBLEM:\n\nFlatpaks and Snap applications run in isolation from rest of the system, therefore they do not have access to the system resources (such as directories, buses and devices) that other applications take for granted. They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case).\n\nDiscover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks.\n\nThe project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks.\n\nPLAN TO IMPLEMENT:\nThe project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. \n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application\n2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application\n3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages\n4. implementation of an \"internal dictionary\" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",

          "description": "The \"metaverse\" has seen exceptional interest in both tech and the wider market. However, metaverse software currently on the market, from Second Life to Horizon Worlds, either limit input to traditional input devices like mice and keyboards, or require expensive gear in the form of VR headsets and specialized controllers. In this project we aim at integrating interaction techniques that rely on human facial and body gestures, similar to these employed in high-fidelity telepresence systems like Google’s Starline, that we will apply to a hybrid presence system and with low-cost hardware to enable accessibility and affordability. This GSoC project aims to perform much needed research into using face tracking as a viable means to improve the accessibility of 3D virtual spaces, much like those found in the metaverse. The result benefits all users, whether or not they have specific needs for accessibility: improved interaction vectors and empathy channels liberate all users. Face tracking software built upon open source technologies will be integrated with Satellite/Mozilla Hubs to provide this crucial feature, enabling a practical testbed for future innovation in hybrid telepresence interaction.",

          "description": "The Shmdata library provides a layer to share streams of framed data between processes via shared memory. It supports any kind of data stream: it has been used with multichannel audio, video frames, 3D models, OSC messages, and various others types of data. Shmdata is server-less, but requires applications to link data streams using socket path (e.g. \"/tmp/my-shmdata-stream\"). Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies.\n\nHowever, permissions are not supported, and any stream shared on the system with Shmdata is accessible system-wide. The project will enable the possibility for a Shmdata user to configure streams permission using shared memory right setting at the API level.\n\nWhen sharing data between processes via shared memory, not all components of the data need to be visible to everyone. Different groups might need to access different data, furthermore, some data might only be needed to be visible to the owner of the files. In such cases, the permissions that would have to be implemented are combinations of 'read', 'write' and 'execute' permissions that would be given to the owner, group or common user(i.e. everyone else).\n\nPermissions would be 'none', 'execute only', 'write only', 'write and execute', 'read only', 'read and execute', 'read and write', 'read, write and execute' with corresponding values of 0-7 respectively.\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\n* Providing an option for users to restrict or openly share data streams via these file/ directory access modes: read, write and execute/traverse.\n\n* Changing data access permissions.\n\n* Documentation for the improvements made.\n\n* Incorporation of ACL to assist with Unix file permissions.

The two use cases which were used in the description were much interested. I was learning with the react over the past 10 months. So I would like to solve the problem in a good manner like combining the react with PHP or Python.  So, First of all, they asked us to build a menu section that should be globally active around the other pages. This can be done by the react components. Which I had the idea of doing it. In the second use case, they asked to create a menu(s) that changes from page to page like the \"Content Moderator Shortcuts\" menu to the \"moderator\" role. Which we can implement with React router dom. But the main task of this objective is to combine the react with drupal. While we know Drupal still serves as a backend repository, front-end frameworks can talk to the database via API calls. By making the  Make a stand-alone front-end and using drupal to create APIs which interact with the database. Then consume the API through HTTP AJAX or whatever mechanism React Js contains.

          "description": "Object detection has made great progress in the past few years along with the development of deep learning. However, most current object detection methods are resource hungry, which hinders their wide deployment to many resource-restricted usages such as usages on always-on devices, battery-powered low-end devices, etc. This project would aim to propose the use of tiny-DSOD for resource-restricted usage. This considers the resource and accuracy trade-off for resource-restricted usages during designing the whole object detection framework. Based on the deeply supervised object detection (DSOD) framework. Tiny-DSOD introduces two innovative and ultra-efficient architecture blocks: depthwise dense block (DDB) based backbone and depthwise feature-pyramid-network (D-FPN) based front-end. We conduct extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark and compare Tiny-DSOD to the state-of-the-art ultra-efficient object detection solutions such as Tiny-YOLO, MobileNet-SSD (v1 & v2), SqueezeDet, Pelee, and Faster-RCNN.",

          "description": "Deep learning is now used to solve many different CV problems. A typical approach is to train a separate network for each specific task. However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly.\nThe project has four objectives:\n1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model.\n2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end.\n3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model.\n4. Using at least one example will demonstrate how to use this multi-task model.",

Clicking this should open a pop-up modal that shows the changes made to the card in that last edit, and a further link at the bottom right saying “Previously edited by XXX at version YYY” which, when clicked, advances the modal to the previous change, and so on.\n\nMy solution approach:\n\nFor part(a), my plan is to first include the exploration metadata properties in the response object during version comparison. After that, a new metadata node will be created in the comparison graph which, on clicking, would show the details of the exploration metadata in a modal.\n\nFor part(b), my plan is to precompute the version history of all the states of an exploration for all the explorations. After that, the version history data will be fetched for the \"active state\" each time the state editor loads or gets updated. After fetching the data, the link \"Last edited by XXX at version YYY\" can be shown to the user and on clicking the link, the comparison data would be fetched and a modal would popup showing the difference between versions YYY and YYY + 1. The modal would contain another link and the same logic will be implemented to update the modal data to the \"previously edited version\" each time the user clicks on the link until they reach the version when the state was created.",

We should not expect developers who are concerned with only the pipelines to install the cli (This does not scale when you have 100+ developers in the company) We do have a UI/dashboard, but it is read only, so users cannot use it to trigger release pipelines or stop running pipelines. In addition, we do not have an audit trail of who did what.

          "description": "The write operation in flash can only change bits in a specific way and the erase operation changes all the bits of a block to 1s. So to modify any bit the whole block needs to be copied to another memory, erased on the flash, and then copied again from the other memory with the change. Due to this “erase overhead” write operations may require copying a lot of data to modify a small amount. Most flash chips support multiple erase-block sizes and flashrom keeps a list of these sizes and ranges for all supported flash chips. Currently, flashrom tries these functions one by one and uses the same function until the operation is completed or an error occurs. Usually, the first function works correctly but this function erases the smallest erase-block so flashrom would have to use it multiple times to complete the erase operation on a large region, which could have been done more efficiently using functions using larger erase-blocks, thus resulting in a transaction overhead. If a large erase-block size to erase a small region is chosen it would result in a larger erase overhead. So the erase-block size should be picked according to the size of the region left to be erased. Also checking in advance to tell if the programmer supports the given erase function and then sorting the supported functions in order of the erase-block sizes can further help the function selection.",

Adding timezone preference for users and adding the time zone field in submitted listens will contribute to the analysis and thus provide better user experience. This project aims to add users’ timezone preference paired with their submitted listens. The main work involves making an appropriate table in Postgres to store timezones, designing a react UI page and implementing the corresponding API endpoints. The stretch goal is to include local timestamp in the API, and extract the timezone information from that timestamp to store in the database. The expected outcome is a finished feature ready to be merged into production code.",

Along with other UI fixes and introducements to enhance the user experience, artist workflow, and efficiency. \n\nThe user interface of any application is one of the most noticeable areas to both new users and old ones. An application's UI can make or break its usability. Therefore, the goal in mind is that by the end of this project these new features implemented will ease and visibly enhance the process of animating for synfig users.The main features to be included:\n\nThese features form the core of this UI enhancement project\n1- Add the possibility to change parameters using the mouse\n2- Ctrl + tab to switch tabs\n3- Shortcuts for switching between animation windows \n4- Show/Hide rulers\n5- Search functionality in parameters panel\n6- Better way to set playback area\n7- Add ability to copy/paste waypoints \n \nAdditional features :\n\n1-  Allow rotation of guides in canvas\n2-  Faster entry of values in value fields\n3- Reducing float precision displayed in parameters values\n4- Fixing inconsistent look of parameter value spin button when expanded\n5- Appropriate adjustment of “paragraph text dialog” size \n\n  Documentation :\n\n1- Documentation of new features whenever applicable: done along the way.\n2- Explanation in more detail of Synfig-Studio in the code-structure section of Synfig    Docs. This is to be done at the end, after spending the whole project time working on  Synfig-studio.",

          "description": "VLC’s 4.0 redesign on the Mac has clearly seen many of the same changes as its counterpart for Linux and Windows, but with a more native-feeling UI on macOS. However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with.\n\nVLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests:\n\n1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar)\n\n2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar\n\n3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app\n\nLastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window. A set of playback controls such as QuickTime’s, which are inconspicuous and relocatable, would be a great addition to VLC and would make the transition for QuickTime users seamless. There would still be opportunities here for VLC’s branding to come through, mainly with the use of accent colours.",

          "description": "Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of events like social migrations, floods, droughts and forest fires, threatening the livelihoods of humans around the world. Because of this, it is urgent to create models that try to predict the responses of ecosystems and also report the degree of uncertainty around their predictions in order to improve policies that can counteract the effects of climate change. Quantifying precisely the degree of uncertainty of models predictions and acknowledging the existing data gaps still remains challenging given the immense variety of data sources that exist and the lack of open source tools that quantify the models' uncertainty. The PEcAn (Predictive Ecosystem global Analyzer) project is an open-source tool that aims to solve this problem by synthesizing multiple data sources for the improvement of model-data feedback. With this tool it is possible to use models for forecasting how an ecosystem might respond to climate change and also is possible to quantify the uncertainty around its predictions. However, currently PEcAn uses a method that do not explore the whole parameter space, giving an incomplete quantification of the uncertainty around important variables in models. Thus, it is necessary to develop new functionalities in PEcAn in order to improve the assessment of ecosystem models' uncertainties. The Sobol Variance Partitioning (SVP) is a method for accessing the degree of uncertainty in models that explore all the parameter space, improving the quantification of model uncertainties. In this project, we will focus on developing a new function within PEcAn that estimates the uncertainty components of a model taking into account higher-order parameter interactions using the SVP method.",

          "description": "The proposed GSoC project aims at integrating support for the Faust audio programming language into HISE, an extensive framework for the creation of sample-based virtual musical instruments.\nThere are multiple ways to accomplish the integration, ahead-of-time compilation and just-in-time compilation, each with their specific benefits and shortcomings.\n\nThe most straight-forward method involves ahead-of-time compilation of the Faust code into a dynamic library which the HISE instrument can interface with.\nThis works well for finished products which will be exported and compiled once, but run many times.\nDuring prototyping, however, build time is essential and relinking the complete instrument would be excessive.\nIn that case machine code will be generated just-in-time (JIT) from the Faust source code whenever it is modified without recompiling or linking the rest of the instrument.\nFaust already provides the necessary mechanisms for just-in-time compilation via LLVM, which will be tied to suitable data structures inside HISE.\n\nLastly HISE also provides an integrated development environment (IDE) with a syntax-highlighting text editor to the instrument developer.\nProgramming the instruments in Faust should be an on-par experience to the developer when comparing to other supported languages, e.g., SNEX and JavaScript.\nTherefore the existing development environment will be extended to support the Faust language, while allowing the developer to still use their editors and tools outside of HISE.",

          "description": "The “Font Selection Improvement” project aims to simplify the selection, and customization of fonts under the Text and Font dialog, reduce the time consumed while selecting the fonts and make this dialog more user-friendly. It includes the addition of the favourite font functionality, recently used fonts, on-canvas live preview of fonts, and listing the fonts used in the document under the Text and Font dialog.\n\nThe project is divided into four different submodules. Each of these submodules represents a feature. Adopting the modular approach towards the addition of these features eases the overall implementation a lot. It further helps in debugging the code at each level. Also, maintaining and developing one feature at a time rather than just diving into the code and creating a complete mess makes the task more manageable and fruitful.",

Its main purpose is to provide an\neasy and convenient way to organize learning resources and build channels for Kolibri.\nUser Experience is a really important aspect of Kolibri Studio as it may involve multiple\nusers working on the same content curation unit (channels). Delayed reflection of the\nmodified state of a channel to a collaborative user may cause inconvenience and may even lead to repetitive change to the same entity.\n\nThe current setup for Real-Time Communication in Studio involves maintaining a\nserver-side log which is being simulated by calling the POST method of sync API. All\ncollaborative users are hitting this POST method at regular intervals to post any changes made by them (if no changes are made then the empty changes array is posted) and receive any changes made by other users as a response of this method.\n\nThe proposed WebSocket architecture will neutralize and reduce the load on the server which is currently being created due to continuous polling of the APIs. It will convert the complex underlying structure of Sync API into a simple real-time-friendly architecture in which a full-duplex communication between client and server takes place.

          "description": "Wireless communication and in particular WiFi networks are becoming more and more important. Research already focuses on improving reliability, performance of such networks and also efficiency of the underlying hardware. One promising candidate for improvements is TX-Power Control (TPC). Adjusting the transmit power per packet basically promises improvements in overall throughput in wireless networks and/or the efficiency by improved resource allocation in wireless networks.\nDated back to 2007, Atheros IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n chipsets driven by ath5k and ath9k Linux drivers did first and Mediatek joined recently with hardware support for tx-power control. Those also allow access to set the tx-power per packet, but yet do not provide a driver interface for this. Unfortunately, also the mac80211 subsystem, which is responsible for WiFi communication in the Linux kernel, does not provide an appropriate API to support TPC and per-packet annotation of tx-power.\n\nThe goal of this project is to implement the missing three-tier software parts: (1) mac80211 structs to annotate tx-power levels per packet, (2) mac80211 structs to account tx-power status information once transmitted and (3) a transmit power control (TPC) API for TPC algorithms. This is achieved by developing and implementing the required structs in the mac80211 subsystem, modifying  Linux WiFi drivers to make use of this API, and testing and validating the implementation in several experiments.",

These calculations allow the researchers to better understand the properties of molecules or the underlying mechanisms of chemical reactions. Multiple distinct calculations have to be performed for calculating the molecular geometry, energy, possible vibrations and optical properties, etc of the molecules. But, Quantum chemistry projects often involve the same series of sequential calculations. Currently, each calculation has to be launched manually, which is often not necessary. \nThis project aims to implement a multi-step calculation protocol to create the data structures to store these protocols and their progress, integrate the automated launch of subsequent steps using the current calculation handling code, add simple verifications after each step completion, and write relevant unit and/or integration tests.",

The main two steps of the program are 1) deriving atomic connectivities from coordinates and 2) determining the most favorable bond ordering from atomic connectivities. Atomic connectivities are found using either the Huckel method or through consideration of van der Waals radii. Favorable bond ordering is determined by considering different possible valences. The project is hence split up into these subparts. Bond ordering, atomic connectivity, formal charges, and the molecule’s conformation, among a few other factors, are combined to create an RDKit mol object.",

          "description": "Code coverage is the percentage of code that is executed by automated tests. Code coverage tells us which lines of a project have been executed and which have not. The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure has upwards of 100,000 tests (unit, regression, and test suite) that can be executed with a single make check-all command, and a very large codebase consisting of millions of lines and multiple subprojects such as Clang, MLIR, OpenMP, Polly etc. \n\nIt is therefore natural that some parts of the compiler are better checked by testcases than others. While code coverage cannot tell us if a given test suite is adequate or not; what it can tell us is if the test suite covers all areas of the codebase. Code coverage metrics also give information about line and branch execution counts which in turn can be used for profile guided optimizations. Code coverage can also tell us about the amount of dead code (unreachable code) in LLVM and such code can be removed. Finally, a codebase wide audit may throw up surprising results and lead to some research papers discussing these results. \n\nIn this proposal I describe how we can go about implementing code coverage for the LLVM codebase, how to interface it with tools like LCOV, and how to integrate GitHub actions such that the coverage percentage for each subproject is displayed in the GitHub repository.",

          "description": "Enzyme performs automatic differentiation (in the calculus sense) of LLVM programs. This enables users to use Enzyme to perform various algorithms such as back-propagation in ML or scientific simulation on existing code for any language that lowers to LLVM. Enzyme already implements forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation. Enzyme also implements vector forward mode automatic differentiation, which allows Enzyme to batch the derivative computation of several objects in a single call. The goal of this project is too extend this capability in order to perform vector reverse mode. In doing so, multiple sweeps of reverse mode automatic differentiation can be performed at the same time, reducing memory, time, and otherwise generally enabling further optimization.",

          "description": "Multiple independent implementations of Rust language support for UEFI have been created, however, all attempts thus far have not been integrated with the EDK II BaseTools build system. This project would involve reconciling all the various UEFI Rust implementations and reconciling Rust's cargo packaging system with the existing EDK II LibraryClass dependency tracking system. Then, UEFI services bindings would need to be defined and implemented for Rust.\n\nCurrent UEFI Rust implementations require no_std Rust code, largely due to the fact that the chances of implementing a full std:: for UEFI in a reasonable timeframe is about 0%. The Rust language designers somewhat assumed any given target OS would provide an implementation of libc as a pre-requisite for implementing std:: however this assumption does not hold well for UEFI. While there is a libc implementation in AppPkg's StdLib this implementation depends on the UEFI shell and thus cannot be used to implement UEFI drivers or DXE drivers, reducing its utility for this task.\n\nHowever, most firmware development use cases don't need a full implementation of std. One can use a statement like extern crate my_std as std; and then implement a subset of std:: and then implement a global default allocator that uses the UEFI AllocatePool() boot service. This would enable a lot of std:: functionality like std::collections. This project should create a subset of std that at a minimum provides a global default allocator for DXE. Since PEI lacks a complete heap implementation, PEIMs implemented in Rust would need to be limited to core::",

However, it presently lacks support for S3 resume, an important feature for mobile platforms. This limits its applicability as-is regarding mainstream use. Therefore, I propose to develop S3 resume support for MinPlatform.\n\nHowever, the S3 resume path can be difficult to debug, like the early PEI phase in general. Since serial ports are commonly either difficult to access or entirely lacking in laptops, closed-chassis debugging options are desirable. While most interface protocols are unavailable until DMA is possible, HDMI offers I2C over the DDC pins. Therefore, I intend to develop support for a debug port over HDMI.",

          "description": "[Problem]\nOpenAFS is a distributed file system. Currently, it has \"File ID\" or FID to \"entry\" or name lookup functionality, AKA, reverse lookup and also normal lookup, which is “name” for a given FID [afs_dir_Lookup and afs_dir_InverseLookup]. afs_dir_InverseLookup is currently computationally expensive because the algorithm scans a hash index data structure embedded within a \"Directory object\" [src/dir/dir.h] looking for a name that matches the given FID. It is not performant as it's merely brute-forcing the search.[src/dir/dir.c]\n\n[Solution]\nMaintain a separate hash table to store reverse lookup information with key: FID and value: name, the opposite of the existing hash table within in the Directory object. I would create this hash table within the Directory object again because it could avoid the penalty of maintaining a global data structure where all the information could be stored, and would also avoid the unnecessary loading of information of the entire volume, if only one file is looked up. Global table for all directories could also perhaps not scale to really large volumes. A \"lazy\" allocation of this table, that is, fill it in only when the first request is made per Directory Object for a \"reverse\" lookup would be efficient.\n\n[Deliverables]\n1. Code\n - Update the existing data structures [DirHeader], hereby referred to as DS.\n - Change the afs_dir_InverseLookup code to use the new DS\n - Lazy load* the information into the DS when the first request is made to “reverse” lookup.\n - Update the code* wherever directory updates are present (like adding and deleting a file inside the directory)\n * Ensure the synchronization primitives are correctly used\n \n2. Tests\n - Correctness tests: check if the written code is working as expected. Asserts can be added to ensure both the hash tables are coherent.\n - Performance tests: check the speed of execution of the current code vs the new code in the same environment (HW and OS)\n\n3.

It also has inbuilt RAM which can hold 64 CAN messages. There is a loopback support also, which can be used for debugging purposes. By adding driver support for CAN modules, will enable the use of this potential hardware. With the help of the Am335x reference manual, TI’s starterware firmware and CAN specification I could understand the initialization and working of the CAN module. With the help of existing RTEMS supported CAN drivers I could understand the CAN framework and develop the support for CAN modules for BBB in RTEMS.\nAm335x has 8 ADC channels (with 7 channels accessible in BBB through pinouts) with 12 bit resolution. The freeBSD has ADC driver support for BBB, So we can port this driver to rtems-libbsd.\nI chose this project because I started learning embedded systems from BeagleBone Black and developed firmware from scratch with few peripherals and shell support https://github.com/slpp95prashanth/Beaglebone-mBootloader/tree/cpsw.

          "description": "I propose to implement \"imcomplete symlink impletentation\" and \"device tree overlays for robotics cape\".\n\n[Problems and Solutions]\n\nBeagleBone has sold a module called Cape, which connects to the BeagleBoard. This Cape was designed for past BeagleBoard and could not be handled directly by BeagleBoneAI, which has a different SoC. They had created a Cape compatibility layer for the BeagleBoneAI that can use the script for other BeagleBoard like BeaglBboneBlack. \n\nHowever, the current implementation has the following problems. This proposal will address these issues.\n\n* There are symbolic links that do not appear by default in the AI.\nThere are symbolic links that do not yet appear in the device tree. For example, SPI, PWM, and CAN peripherals have no symlink. If you use this device tree as it is, these peripherals are not available in the standard state.\n\nThe work is to create a corresponding udev rule, for example, and put it on the symlink so that it can be handled by BeagleBone AI's file system.\n\nThe symlink we want to create is as follows:\nGPIO (for gpio-leds and gpio-keys),\nPWM,\nSPI,\nCAN,\n\n* Need device tree overlay for Robotics Cape.\nCurrently, Compatible Overlays are available for the various types of Capes offered by BeagleBone. However, no overlays are yet available for the Robotics Cape. These will need to be created.\n\nThe first step is to create a device tree overlay based on Device Tree for Robotics Cape on BeagleBone Black, following the Device Tree Overlay Creation Article\".\n\n* No demo code explaining how to use each Cape.\nCurrently we do not yet have demo code for each Cape to see how it works with the device tree overlay for each Cape. I need to add demo code for each Cape, or otherwise prepare documentation for developers and end users.\n\n[Benefit]\n* A Compatibility Layer for BeagleBone AI will be added, allowing Robotics Cape to be handled by AI.\n* Various tutorials will be added to the Capes to help the user understand how to use it.",

          "description": "Greybus is an application layer for UniPro, communications happen over bidirectional connections between entities. The physical bus is attached to the connected device, running Zephyr. A virtual bus, corresponding to the physical bus on the connected device, is created on the Linux side. The physical and virtual bus functionality appears the same to a user. Greybus is used to exchange bus-specific messages and data between the connected device and Linux. Since Greybus is an application, it can be used over other protocols and buses such as TCP/IP, Bluetooth or UART with the help of GBridge.\n\nThe Linux kernel's IIO subsystem contains drivers for many sensors. Several mikrobus boards do not have kernel drivers, which will have to be written and merged upstream.\n\nThis project aims to support all relevant peripherals on BeagleConnect Freedom on Greybus for Zephyr. This involves adding platform-specific changes to enable these protocols and interfaces to existing NuttX sources. Each peripheral will be tested over a mikrobus add-on board over Greybus using its corresponding driver in the kernel.\n\nMikrobus drivers will be updated to probe device drivers for the new peripherals added automatically. Greybus will also be updated with support for gb-log, which can be used for logging data from remote nodes and gb-loopback, which can be used for greybus transaction throughput testing.\n\nThe Zephyr Project provides a native POSIX target that can run on the host OS without emulation. This eliminates the need for architecture-specific hardware in the early phases of development. This target lacks several features which prevent it from being used in Greybus testing. A goal would be to generate Greybus traffic for testing and fleshing out the native-POSIX target to demonstrate Greybus message handling.",

The BeagleWire is a Lattice iCE40HX FPGA development platform compatible with the Beagleboards.  This project has two goals, to implement a RISC-V based PRU and to improve the reliability of standalone cores on BeagleWire.\n\nA programmable real-time unit (PRU) is a fast (200-MHz, 32-bit) processor providing single-cycle I/O access to peripherals on Beagleboards. PRUs allow for the combination of flexibility of an OS system and the timing of a microcontroller, and are handy to avoid throwing in another device on top of the Beagleboard to control or interface with a new peripheral. Implementing this on an FPGA cape allows the implementation of a open source PRU-like CPU on an open ISA, and also allows for more flexibility, relief CPU and potentially for a better clock frequency trade-offs. In this project, existing RISC-V based implementations FPGA will be explored and adapted for this purpose.\n\nStandalone cores on the BeagleWire cape still suffer from reliability issues. The most notable known issue is with the SDRAM interface working sporadically.  The second goal of the project is to test and improve the reliability of each of the subsystems (SPI, PWM, UART, SDRAM, etc) on the BeagleWire.",

Visualizing such data is quite a challenging task, considering the large amount of data to be displayed. The feature viewer is an open source javascript library developed to visualize biological data (referred to as features) mapped to a linear sequence (Paladin et al., 2020). For instance, it can be configured to visualize the location of protein domains or amino acid variations in a protein sequence. The feature viewer is being used in several popular bioinformatics resources such as neXtProt and COSMIC 3D.\n\nCurrently, the feature viewer supports limited configurability options in the features displayed, such as the color, shape and on-click behavior. This is too restrictive for some of the possible use cases of the feature viewer, where more flexibility is required in the display of features. One such instance is when different types of amino acid variants should be displayed in a color-specific manner in the same feature track.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the configurability of the feature viewer, such that it allows greater flexibility in the visualization of detailed biological data.",

OpenMS is one of the most widely acknowledged tools in computational MS analysis, without which many exciting scientific breakthroughs would not be possible. With the development of mass spectrometers with high resolution and sensitivity, the amount and size of data generated by mass spectrometry has been increasing rapidly. The previously established data format, mzML, which is in essence an XML file, cannot be efficiently stored or accessed when the file size is huge. In response to the need of a space- and time-efficient data format to store MS data, a new data format mzMLb has been introduced. It adopts the hierarchical HDF5 format which allows the application of BLOSC compression filters to gain a huge compression rate with splendid IO performance. OpenMS currently does not support this file format as an input.\nThis proposal aims to implement an IO module for mzMLb files for OpenMS, which provides variou compression filters including the most efficient BLOSC filter and customizable chunk size plus other options.

          "description": "Until today, playing games has become an activity loved by many, mainly due to the fun and competitiveness offered to those who play them. In Liquid Galaxy, a few games were developed that are supported by the cluster system, such as the Galaxy Pong, Galaxy Snake and more, in which lots of them were based on old famous games.\nOne of the first major hits of arcade games was Asteroids, released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field and the objective of the game is to increase the score by shooting and destroying the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' shot. The game gets harder as new asteroids spawn.\n\nFollowing this logic, the project's idea is to remake the original Asteroids game, with a modern design and new features, such as the multiplayer mode. It would be really nostalgic and fun to be able to play it again, especially for those who played it back in the 80's and 90's. Moreover, due to its complexity, uniqueness and system support, the project may be a part of the Liquid Galaxy demonstration, bringing more emphasis to the lab.",

Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a typical example of a constraint-based metabolic model (CBMM) [2]. However, flux sampling is considered a superior methodology. Python package dingo provides the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling (MMC) algorithm to sample from the flux space of a metabolic network. However, the preprocessing methods implemented in dingo need major improvements regarding memory allocation. The goal of this project is to improve the preprocessing methods in dingo to support faster sampling and rounding pipelines.",

          "description": "We study the sampling of correlation matrices from a given probability density, which has applications in various scientific, engineering and business areas (biology, finances,...). This problem is technically difficult due to the constraints of correlation matrices (entries in [-1,1], positive semi-definiteness). The current methods can only scale to a few tens of dimensions.\n\nThis project aims to provide efficient C++ implementations for new geometric-flavored algorithms to sample correlation matrices (Arakelian, Chalkis 2021)  and integrate them into VolEsti, an open-source high-performance software for sampling, volume computing and geometric statistics. Our main tasks consist of implementing a new class of convex bodies to represent the space of correlation matrices and geometric operations for performing two random walk sampling algorithms (the accelerated billiard walk and Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm) over those convex bodies. These tasks can be supported by the already existing geometric facilities of VolEsti and the theoretical results found in related works. We will focus mainly on building an optimized C++ code to achieve better scalability for those algorithms and carry out intensive experiment and benchmark with other competitors to justify our efficiency. \n\nThe expected duration of this project is 175 hours spread over 7 weeks of coding period (June 13 - July 29). The C++ implementation obtained by the end of this project will expand VolEsti towards an all-in-one high-performance statistic tools for research and business uses.",

A great number of optimization algorithms that are developed leverage sampling. The goal of this project is to equip the VolEsti library with a Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC) sampler constrained on convex bodies and then use it for the implementation of optimization algorithms. The implemented sampler should return samples from log-concave distributions constrained in polytopes as well as spectrahedra.  First of all, the initial implementation will be based on very recent promising research about an RHMC algorithm constrained in polytopes. We will expand on this effort by extending its capabilities to handle Spectrahedra. Afterwards, the above implementation will be used as a subroutine for a Semidefinite Program (SDP) solver. Last but not least, we will also include benchmark tests to compare the efficiency of our code against other state of the art libraries. As a summary, the project's deliverables will consist of the implementation of: an RHMC sampler first constrained on polytopes, then extended on spectrahedra, SDP optimization algorithms that use RHMC and finally testing against other libraries.",

DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia.\nTo reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU.\nWe believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation.\nI aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",

Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question \"What is the set containing all possible final states?\" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for  both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation.\nThe goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization.

They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. \n\nIn classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates?  \n\nSimulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",

The hybrid variant (HDS) sits in the middle in terms of accuracy and speed between DS and FDS. Since demands for the two differ according to situation, it makes sense to implement all thre versions (DS, FDS, and HDS) so that everyone interested can use the one most suitable to their situation. This is the purspose of this project. Additionally, the algorithms in question will be extended to be applied to multi-label problems as well.",

          "description": "Time to First Plot (TTFP) is one of the most disliked things about Julia language because it takes from seconds to minutes to produce the first output. This is caused by the underlying Just-In-Time compilation, and the current solution is to build a user system image containing pre-loaded libraries with precompiled code. However, the workflow is primarily manual, and users are forced to recompile the system image after any package update. Currently, Julia's developers work on introducing system-image-like blobs containing compiled native code for a specific package. However, both these methods compile only package-specific precompile statements by default, and the project will introduce a new package to change this paradigm. The package would collect precompile statements during normal usage of Julia and offer to recompile the system image (or blobs) once the libraries are updated. The provided images would fit the specific user's needs and contain compiled code that would not be compiled by the default.",

          "description": "Overall, the proposal is about adding a few missing features in the package, like addition of new models, some metaprogramming, lazy evaluation, testing, documentation and linting. \nCurrently, the package only supports four regression models (Linear, Logistic, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression). There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package.\nThere is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",

For example, the Julia REPL requires additional packages to display images in the REPL and is inconvenient for repeated use. Images also clog the REPL, making it more inconvenient when pre-processing data. On the other hand, notebooks lack debugging tools and waste a lot of space in their layouts.\n\nA straightforward and extensible solution that uses the REPL and customizes it to our needs can bridge this feature and convenience gap. The TermLayouts.jl project aims to add extensions to the REPL and introduce a layout in which these extensions can be moved and resized to fit the user's needs. This layout can further be customized using a configuration file.\n\nThis project will also seek to provide some essential extensions which most users would like to have. These extensions include a variable inspector, a fully-fledged debugger, and a plot area for displaying images.\n\nAll the code will be thoroughly tested using unit tests and documented extensively for future ease of maintenance.",

OWID uses a range of choropleth maps, but size-scaled maps have downsides, primarily because human visual perception associates areas with importance. Furthermore, readily available alternatives use mosaic cartograms, which distort the shape of countries.\n\nTo solve this problem, in a sentence, the primary objective is to plot a visually conclusive world map by illustrating territories/countries using a method for trading off shape and area.\n\nThe basic idea of the solution is to distort the size-scaled world map while preserving the shape of countries to generate a population-scaled world map. Furthermore, a manually generated population-scaled world map acts as the reference for optimizing the cost function for better results.\n\nFinally, an option to rearrange the cells in the grid to nitpick the details yields the final result of the cartogram.",

          "description": "My project's goal is to enhance the capabilities of Doodle,  a 2D graphics Scala library. One common use case for Doodle is in Creative Scala, a gentle introduction to functional programming designed to help new developers learn functional programming concepts in a visual way. \n\nCurrently, Doodle provides basic support for loading bitmaps. The limitation of this in the current implementation is that bitmaps are loaded as a common type following the vector graphics model used in the rest of Doodle. However, this is not desirable because bitmaps are distinct from the vector graphics model. Some bitmap operations do not make sense on vector images and vice versa. \n\nThis project plans to solve this limitation by creating a separate type representing bitmaps, providing the means for more interesting operations and visualizations that come with bitmaps. In addition, new bitmap operations will be added to the library, starting with convolution operations. By doing so, this project aims to enhance the appeal for new developers to pick up Scala by enabling more powerful image filtering capabilities similar to that of social applications they are familiar with. In the process, Doodle might become more commonly used in other Scala applications for 2D graphic rendering.",

          "description": "Scala Native is an ahead-of-time and prevalent compiler for Scala. The traditional compilation is to compile Scala into Java Virtual Machine(JVM) bytecodes, which are executed by JVM. Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",

WasmEdge is one such project that aims to bring WebAssembly to the edge.\n\nTo provide  a unified  interface, a interface between WasmEdge and the host operating system has to be built.

          "description": "Running Kubernetes should be done with the utmost security in mind. KubeArmor provides a policy based system to increase the quality of security in a Kubernetes cluster. Users need to define their own policy when implementing KubeArmor. Most users might find it challenging to define the most appropriate and effective security policy based on their use case. Currently there are limited ways for users to actually get observability data that can be used to assist them and provide better reasoning when creating an optimal security policy. The solution to this problem is by providing visibility telemetry events to show pod or container observability data. Observability data can consist of processes executions, file system accesses, and network accesses. This information is expected to assist users to create an optimal security policy. This solution is implemented by developing and deploying a Kubernetes service that will connect to the KubeArmor relay and get the events from the daemonsets. These events will then be aggregated and stored in the database for future use. Users can get the data by using the KubeArmor CLI program which will be extended to accommodate this solution.",

          "description": "For GHC 9.2.x to achieve more widespread adoption, tooling will need to support its best features. For years users have been frustrated by Haskell's conspicuous lack of support for namespacing features common in other languages. Haskell provides a limited form of namespacing with qualified imports, but using it to namespace field selectors tends to require hacky file structures. Fortunately, Haskell now provides `DuplicateRecordFields`, and GHC 9.2 introduced the `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension. These together provide a cleaner and more ergonomic interface for working with record types, a step towards better namespace support in Haskell.\n\nHLS already supports record dot-syntax to a small extent. For example, in the line `y = x.a`, type information is available when hovering over `y` or `x`. To unlock the full potential of this syntax though, HLS users should be able to \"dot into\" the record to see its fields, enabling IDE-driven API exploration. Additionally, type information for the `.a` part should be available to the user on hover. These are the main features I propose to add to HLS for this project.",

          "description": "The architecture of the GHC compiler in its current state is anti-modular. Designed with GHC-the-program as the sole consumer in mind, it is very difficult for newer tooling to reuse its components. These problems extend to the inclusion of new backends such that implementations for various target platforms forked GHC frequently.\n\nThe first step to improving the current design is the isolation of the different components and separation the codebase in layers for different purposes, described in the classic book \"Domain Driven Design\". This is already partly done, and in this project I join the existing effort by working on the next remaining subsystem: GHC's Core pipeline.\n\nIn order to achieve my goal, I will proceed by using an incremental bottom-up approach: Starting at the bottom of the module hierarchy, I will push references to upper layers module-by-module up in the callstack until they are completely removed from each component. For the entry points of each in-scope component, I will then provide component-specific configuration types and corresponding initialization functions. The in-scope components are specific configurable tasks of the optimizer, and the optimizer as a whole.\n\nWith this work completed, there will be significantly less references to the ubiquitous global states used throughout the whole compiler, namely the DynFlags and the HscEnv type, and significantly fewer imports of modules from upper layers, e.g. the driver.",

It would be beneficial to generalize GHC's runtime, make it separable from GHCSM, and connect it with a suite of different garbage collections from MMTk.\n\n\nTo achieve this goal, we propose to:\n1. Refactor GHC's runtime system to more effectively abstract over storage management operations;\n2. Introduce a storage management backend using MMTk's trivial no-GC collection plan;\n3. Integrate write barriers necessary for generational collection with MMTk;\n4. Introduce support for MMTk's semi-space and mark-sweep GC plans.",

          "description": "The international Belle II collaboration handles huge amounts of data from the Belle II detector, relying on custom software for simulation, reconstruction,\nvisualization, and analysis. This software, developed over the past decade by hundreds of physicists, is constantly evolving to optimize the algorithms for better physics performance and resource efficiency. \n\nGiven the size, diversity and dynamic nature of the development team, quality assurance of the software is a big challenge. Belle II Software has had several monitoring schemes implemented so far, along with a high-level validation tool. This tool runs on existing large datasets producing distribution plots of quantities relevant for physics analyses and displaying the results on a webpage. This project aims to improve this validation tool. Bookkeeping of known issues detected by the tool, along with improved logging and integration with the issue tracking system can help fast track root cause analyses. The plots generated can also display more relevant information, and point toward the datasets used to encourage the reuse of common artefacts. \n\nThe plan is to enhance the user experience of the Belle II software validation tool and make workflows more efficient with appropriate technical solutions. We will start with integrating the issue tracking system with the validation tool, to better track the history of degradations. The plotting module will be overhauled to include relevant software information, as well as hyperlinks to make them self-sufficient. Enhancements to the logging module to have better logs attached directly to the issues from the validation tool to fast track issue debugging. The common artefacts will be pooled together in a manner allowing for easy reference from plots, logs and issues and also to prevent regeneration overheads. All the changes will be integrated with the production code, after rigorous testing, along with detailed documentation.",

These are -\n1)  Decompression of bitmaps is slow with EWAH. To know if an object is\nrelated to a particular commit, we have to decompress the whole thing.\n\n2. Loading a `.bitmap` file can be slow for large bitmaps. This is because we\nneed to read the file sequentially in order to discover the offset of each\nbitmap within the file.\n\n3. Regenerating bitmaps can take a long time.\n\n4. If we solve the above points, we would think of other aspects like\nrethinking how we select which commit receives bitmaps etc.\n\nNow there are multiple ways to solve these problems. Point to point solution is given below - \n\n1. There are better and more modern techniques than EWAH for compressing. Roaring+run bitmap can be used as an alternative to EWAH. So that, we can optimize the performance of compressing/decompression. I will also write performance tests to verify that.\n\nOne possible approach  to problem no. 3, is to add a new mode that only adds new bitmaps for commits introduced between successive bitmap generations.\n\nTo solve problem no. 2, we can create a `table of contents for these bitmaps.

          "description": "Utilizing cloud FPGAs prove to be very expensive and minor coding bugs could consume precious compute cycles and incur hefty bills. This proves using FPGAs on AWS F1, virtually ineffective for students, enthusiasts and early researchers. Additionally, 1st CLaaS, already has a streaming interface in place, not all hardware accelerators would require continuous streaming of data. The addition of support for Memory Mapped Interfaces like AXI4, AXI4 Lite, Wishbone and custom interfaces similar to RoCC, Core-V eXtension interface etc., would enable a wider ecosystem of hardware accelerators to support 1st CLaaS integration without any RTL Level modifications. \n\nBesides these, supporting 1st CLaaS on Local FPGAs/Remote FPGAs contrary to AWS F1 would prove useful to enthusiasts, researchers, professors and students having FPGA on-premise or remotely accessible. 1st CLaaS for PYNQ leverages the PYNQ (Python Productivity for Zynq) Framework, which consists of a Jupyter Server running in a Linux Operating system on the ARM Processor in the Zynq SoC. Addressing the current limitations of 1st CLaaS, the proposed framework that not only brings 1st CLaaS to PYNQ FPGAs, but also vendor agnostically automates TL-Verilog/Verilog/SystemVerilog based Hardware accelerator design from RTL to bitstream and deployment eliminating the need to interact with a wide range of vendor specific tools.

It will allow for a Raspberry Pi running NetBSD to take advantage of the dedicated graphics processor, which could be useful for other programs which currently use software rasterization to utilize OpenGL ES. Specifically, the project will be compatible with Mesa as-is, allowing existing programs which depend on Mesa for graphics API support to be able to support the Raspberry Pi's GPU under NetBSD. This will be solved by porting the existing driver to be managed inside a NetBSD loadable kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime when needed. When complete, this will allow for OpenGL ES programs which have been ported to NetBSD from Linux, and already utilize the GPU under Linux to similarly use the GPU under NetBSD, such as programs which can render a triangle, a teapot, and some games.",

          "description": "KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. \n\nFirstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be \"in graph mode\". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT.\n\nSecondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling.\n\nI also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build \"building blocks\" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks.\n\n\nText augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement.\n\nThe above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",

          "description": "Data Scarcity is a Huge and Evergrowing Problem as new tasks and problems are tackled. Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases.\nThrough my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \\\nThe 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation\nAll of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list.\nBy the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",

          "description": "I will potentially work towards the following problems during the GSoC:\n\n1)  I am excited to implement advanced algorithms in JAX and create/re-produce demos/figures to put in textbooks. For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as  lax.scan() to optimize the training loop.\n\n2)  I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book.  For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. \n\n3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9  shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",

          "description": "Today, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) claim most of the lives across the globe. Considering the gravity of this situation, analyzing, and diagnosing CVDs has quickly become a crucial task. However, in the presence of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) (doctors, radiologists, etc.…) this task becomes trivial, but in the absence of SMEs diagnosing CVDs with the help of an Electrocardiogram (ECG), a Phonocardiogram (PCG) is almost always impossible. In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is drastically underfunded and the vast majority of these countries are unable to provide basic healthcare to the public. In such conditions, the availability of radiologists or doctors is very unlikely. Automated analysis and classification of PCG signals and ECG images without the presence of any subject matter expert (SME) is a crucial task.

          "description": "For simulating a system that contains many variables and/or equations, traditionally computational engineers tend to focus on utilizing an appropriate method with realistic time and space complexity. The technique of model order reduction (MOR), however, aims at approximating the original model with reduced number of variables and/or equations and still keeping sufficient accuracy. MOR is especially useful in various industries, for example thermal-fluids engineering, micro-electro-mechanical systems and control, where large-scale simulations have to be performed.\n\nThe methods of model order reduction can be classified into several classes including proper orthogonal decomposition, reduced basis, balanced truncation, etc. Several MOR libraries have been well developed in MATLAB and Python. For instance, pyMOR is a Python library that relies on the application of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations. MATLAB's model reducer supports pole-zero simplification, balanced truncation mode selection methods and so on.\n\nIn Julia, the main package that enables symbolic modeling is ModelingToolkit.jl, whose key features consist of automatic transformation and structural simplification, but it needs further works on fast ML approximate transformations. So this project is targeted on implementing MOR methods as extended features for ModelingToolkit.jl. Besides implementation of methods of model order reduction, the expected deliverables will include documentation which shows both the improved simulation time and accuracy penalty for the application of different MOR methods on test problems from various disciplines.",

          "description": "Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs), a type of Bayesian nonparametric models, have recently gained strong attention from researchers, and become an active research topic in machine learning’s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. This provides a useful and practical approach for various applications in different fields. \n\nThe creation of new sampling methods and the advance in computing power have paved the way for the development of Bayesian models. Different software frameworks have been built to facilitate this probabilistic programming approach. Among those, PyMC is one of the most popular frameworks with a large and strong community. PyMC provides friendly interfaces that allow users in academics and industries to perform both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian data analysis. For Bayesian nonparametric models, the Gaussian process module in PyMC supports various mean and kernel classes. However, the current GP implementations in PyMC are limited to single output. This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC. This feature would significantly extend the capabilities of this important module and benefit the PyMC community.",

          "description": "The study of urban morphology relies on clever abstractions of the built environment into computationally tractable models. One such model, the street network, is a graph whose edges are streets and nodes are street intersections. Network analysis tools are often tailored for street networks with the purpose of routing. In shortest path computations, network data must carefully reflect not only urban infrastructure but also the intricacy of transportation policies–such as multiple lanes and traffic direction. From the perspective of urban morphology, these features add noise to the geometric order of cities. Perpendicular two-lane streets cross in four intersections, producing a dummy city block, for example. Street networks carefully processed to answer pressing accessibility questions are not suitable for morphological analysis.\n\nWe would like to develop source-agnostic functions to process street network data for meaningful morphological analysis. The final network should be, at least, free from multiple nodes representing the same intersection and multiple edges representing the same street. This processing must rely on inherent network properties such as node connectivity and edge lengths, but not on auxiliary data such as OSM tags and building footprints. The functions will be collected under pysal’s momepy module, added to an existing toolbox of scalable urban morphological analysis.",

          "description": "The project aims to fill the current gap in the creation of a baseline urban grid that allows for network analysis of the morphology of street networks. The idea of the project is to develop a set of tools within the current momepy.preprocessing module that combined with the current integration of NetworkX can output a solid, consistent and repeatable analysis of the urban form. \nGiven that other libraries have also approached this issue (namely osmnx.simplification and citiyseer.tools.graphs), the idea is to contribute from the persisting issues of such libraries to then continue with a solution that is much more independent. Issues like multiple Points on LineStrings, snapping ends, and curving segments have already been addressed by such tools, but parallel LineStrings, and enclosed Linestrings (eg. round-abouts) still need to be resolved, to name a few. It seems that a categorization of the different topological issues (likely similar to the ones just mentioned) could create a framework from which to approach a final pipeline. However, it is proposed that early tests of different potential avenues be performed to sketch a planning route going forward (one of such tests is exemplified under the Approach section). The ideal solution is expected to be source-agnostic, but also leverage the current efforts already done by the community.\nOverall, the idea is to prioritize work alongside the mentors and the community to focus on increasing the short-term benefits of all PySAL/GeoPandas users (some of whom might already be familiar with some of the other corrections). As the project progresses over different iterative approaches, it is expected to incorporate more performance tests to counterbalance the feasibility of each approach as well as to build the desired autonomy of the tools to be reliant exclusively on input geometries.",

          "description": "Graph Isomorphism is an exciting topic regarding networks, but also a fairly complex problem to solve. The goal of the project is the full implementation of the VF2++ algorithm, which is an improved version of the original VF2 algorithm, extended to directed and multigraph settings, in a nonrecursive manner. \n\n\nThe brief description of the original algorithm (VF2) is that, after verifying  that both the input graphs have the same number of nodes and the exact same degree sequences, it starts constructing a mapping, between the nodes of the two graphs. If the mapping can be extended such that, every node from the first graph is matched to a node of the second graph, then the two graphs are considered to be Isomorphic.\n\nThe imporved version (VF2++), performs a preprocess, during which, a matching order is found, such that the algorithm is able to recognize the feasibility of the examined branches, avoiding a significant amount of computations by excluding the infeasible ones. \n\nThe plan to solve the problem is the following.\n\nStep 1: \nextensive research, questions asked and ideas discussed with the mentors.

          "description": "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a flexible class of probabilistic models which can automatically fit quite complex functions. In addition, GPs provide a principled means of computing the predictive uncertainty. PyMC includes an implementation of GPs as a result of a previous GSoC contributor. However, Gaussian processes are notorious for being very expensive to compute. Training a GP scales cubically with the training data points. This gets prohibitively expensive even for a few thousand training data points. There has been quite a lot of recent research in speeding up the training of GPs and this proposal will implement plans to implement a recently proposed GPU accelerated exact GP model [1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/27e8e17134dd7083b050476733207ea1-Abstract.html)",

PyMC is a Python probabilistic programming library for Bayesian modelling and there are ongoing efforts to add a DP functionality to the package. DPs are daunting both theoretically and computationally as their non-trivial implementation would benefit from polished non-user facing methods in Aesara - formerly Theano - and AePPL. The former provides the computational backend to PyMC whereas AePPL converts arbitrary Aesara graphs into equivalent log-probability graphs which are convenient for automatic differentiation and hence sampling. The goals of my proposed Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project are threefold: relax the univariate assumption of components in mixture models, allow the creation of mixture graph via IfElse and Switch statements and continue ongoing efforts to add a DP functionality to PyMC.",

Oftentimes the visualization of these threats are in terms of color-coded hazard maps, which do not convey the urgency or the threat level to the general public at risk, resulting in loss of life and property. Traditional rendering of simulations are also not feasible when simulating millions of material points being written to a disk at a fixed time interval. CB-Geo MPM offers a scalable parallel system for running regional-scale landslide hazard simulations.

          "description": "Electromagnetic devices have become ubiquitous in our lives due to their limitless applications. For designing and optimizing such devices, non-uniform and unstructured meshes are essential, due to the multiscale nature of the problem. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is well known for handling such meshes. FEniCSx is an open-source platform for solving partial differential equations with the FEM, offering high-level Python and C++ interfaces. It has become a popular choice among FEM users, especially for solid mechanic and fluid dynamic applications. However, FEniCSx has not met the same popularity for electromagnetic applications due to the lack of comprehensive demos showing how to correctly setup and solve electromagnetic partial differential equations, and therefore many researchers and engineers in this field prefer to use other (often commercial) FEM platforms. This proposal aims to solve this issue by developing extensive and accessible electromagnetic demos for a number of case studies. In particular, the work will focus on delivering at least five demos (plus tests and documentation), regarding 1) the use of complex numbers, the implementation of 2) Scattering Boundary Conditions, 3) Perfectly Matched Layers, and 4) Maxwell's equations for axisymmetric structures, and 5) the parallelization of a parameterized problem with the MPI COMM_SELF communicator.  These additions will be a step towards the extensive use of FEniCSx in the electromagnetic community since they will provide working tools for real-world problems. The demos will also be a show-reel for new features of FEniCSx that have not been covered in past demos or tutorials. A long term effect of this work could be more developers involved in the FEniCSx project, more guiding feedback from end users, and promotion of open source software for electromagnetic/photonic simulations.",

Thus, the Project represents an opportunity to contribute to and demonstrate the utility of PyMC following a real-case scenario. For that, we will firstly update the existing implementation by migrating them to Aesara while keeping the same mathematical equations and referencing them accordingly. We will then implement Linear Gaussian State Space modelling and Kalman filter, a discrete-time process, and apply it to a temporal gene-expression dataset to showcase the applicability of PyMC in chemical safety assessment and decision making.\n \nThe main deliverables include:\nD1.

These methods would allow the HARK toolkit to provide open source software for economic researchers to solve heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models. \n \nTo implement these computational methods, objects and tools in HARK will be extended to allow for the efficient simulation of a macroeconomic model, the computation of Jacobians to linearize a model, and the computation of impulse responses to a linearized model.\n\nAt the completion of this project, economic researchers will be able to simply specify the equations that define their model and be immediately returned the solutions to their model.",

However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. \n\nThere are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code.  Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",

When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are:\n\n1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files \n2) Developing the import functionality\n3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers\n4) Writing unit tests\n5) Documenting the new changes",

The implementation of the project is estimated to last from June to November (Large Size Project) and the timeline is envisaged as follows: During the 1st Phase (June 2022 - July 2022) a snapshot will be added for testing the latest version of JBoss Community Server. The newly added snapshot will be made available for use with the CI builds. Moreover, the extension of EAT with additional multiversion android projects (described at the second phase) will begin. Continuing to the 2nd Phase (July 2022 - September 2022), new multiversion Android projects will be added to EAT. In EAT there is already a basic android  multiversion example. This will be extended with other open source android projects demonstrating how EAT can be used to support multiversion real life android projects. Finally, during the 3rd Phase ( September 2022 – November 2022) a multi-version Android application will be developed and added to EAT. This app will enable users to upload  and view descriptions and ways of usage for various programs or functions.

But at the same time, it’s also a potentially dangerous distraction to use your phone while driving.\n\nSimilarly interacting with the enviroCar Android app while driving is a serious concern, as it may result in an accident if the driver is distracted. This is why adding voice command features to the app has become a must feature.\n\nHence This summer I will be working on automating the enviroCar application’s actions via voice commands to provide a user-friendly experience.",

It is the backbone for OGC services, clients and middleware.\n\t\tOne of the important components of the Arctic Sea framework is Faroe. Faroe is a configuration API currently featuring a JSON and a SQLite backend. It enables the injection and automatic configuration of settings of various types in classes, including a Spring BeanPostprocessor. It allows us to set properties for OGC services. \n\tThe problem statement thus asks to create a web frontend to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) the JSON settings with a REST API on top of faroe API. I will try to develop a user-friendly UI for the same and make sure CRUD operations are carried out properly through UI, making it extensible and customizable.
